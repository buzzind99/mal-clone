He and his family and friends belonged to a tribe of Mountain People who lived and hunted and farmed high in the hills near the Fire Mountain.\n\nThis is a comedy series earmarked by infectious chibi-cuteness mixed with the pathos of every-day prehistoric life. The storylines revolves around the adventures of Kum Kum (pronounced coom-coom) and his young friends. Kum Kum has a real knack for getting himself (and the other kids) in trouble and that's what makes the series fun!\n\n(Source: kumkum.8thman.com)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1975,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":577,"type":"anime","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":["\"Kum Kum no Uta (クムクムのうた)\" Columbia Yurikago Kai, Mitsuko Horie"],"endings":["\"Saurus-kun (サウルスくん)\" by Columbia Yurikago Kai, Tatsuya Kishi, Mitsuko Horie"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
