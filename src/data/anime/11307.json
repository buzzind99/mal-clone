Space differs from the rest of the Once Upon a Time titles in the sense that the series revolve on a dramatic content rather than an educational premise. The series still has a handful of educational information (such as an episode discussing the rings of Planet Saturn).\n\nThe series succeeds Once Upon a Time... Man. It reprises almost the entire totality of the characters of the previous series and adapts them into a science-fiction context.\n\nThe story tells about the confrontation of many big galactic powers. Among them there is the Omega Confederation, of which Earth is a member of; the military republic of Cassiopée led by the general Le Teigneux; and a powerful supercomputer which controls an army of robots. Once Upon a Time... Space features the adventures of Pierrot (son of colonel Pierre and president Pierrette) and his friend Psi.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":191,"type":"anime","name":"Eiken","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/191/Eiken"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":3624,"type":"anime","name":"Seimei no Kagaku: Micro Patrol","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3624/Seimei_no_Kagaku__Micro_Patrol"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Ashita no Ginga e (あしたの銀河へ)\" by ピーカブー","2: \"Ginga no Joou (銀河の女王)\" by Tatsuya Matsuno"],"endings":["1: \"Ai no Mori (愛の森)\" by ピーカブー","2: \"Yoake no Prelude (夜明けのプレリュード)\" by Tatsuya Matsuno"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
