No problem! When Force-Gem alerts, it's time to get suit on! With Mini Force and their transforming mechanics, it’s time to sweep! \n\n(Source: Samg Animation)","background":"This show was given two English dubs. The first English dub was shared on (the first season) while the second English dub was made available on Netflix (all episodes). The studio used for the first English dub is also the same studio who dubbed Armor Hero, Armor Hero XT and various other English dubs for Alpha Animation's own animated shows. MiniForce marks the very first time that a ​blue ranger is used under the leadership role within a \"sentai\" (task force) series. It was co-produced between EBS and Choirock Contents Factory. It aired on EBS in 2 seasons, starting on August 2014. In 2015 it was awarded the Korea Content Award and the Ministry of Culture & Sports Award.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"14:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 14:30 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2541,"type":"anime","name":"SAMG Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2541/SAMG_Entertainment_"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":46846,"type":"anime","name":"Miniforce: Super Dino Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/46846/Miniforce__Super_Dino_Power"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
