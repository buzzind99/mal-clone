He vows to prove that aliens are real in honor of his late friend. A transfer student named Neko Kuroha unexpectedly arrives one day, bearing a striking resemblance to the late Kuroneko—even sharing a similar name. Most mysteriously, she seems to possess supernatural powers.\n\nAs Ryouta takes more interest in Neko, he is drawn into a deadly world where dangerous scientists hunt magic-wielding witches that have escaped from their secret research laboratory. Neko is one of these escapees, but there are many others who are in similar situations, and it's up to Ryouta to protect them from their would-be captors.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Gokukoku no Brynhildr adapts the first 10 volumes of Lynn Okamoto's manga series of the same name.","season":"spring","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Arms","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/38/Arms"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":34377,"type":"manga","name":"Gokukoku no Brynhildr","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/34377/Gokukoku_no_Brynhildr"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":24695,"type":"anime","name":"Gokukoku no Brynhildr: Kara Sawagi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/24695/Gokukoku_no_Brynhildr__Kara_Sawagi"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"BRYNHILDR IN THE DARKNESS -Ver.
