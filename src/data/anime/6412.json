In most ways she is every bit the typical teen—except she doesn't exist.\n\nThe invention of acclaimed computer animator Kenichi Kutsugi, Yuki Terai is Japan's No.1 Virtual Star. Capable of unprecedented life-like expressions and movement, she inhabits many worlds: real-life, science fiction and music. And now she can inhabit yours.\n\nIn Secrets, the multi-faceted Yuki is showcased in six irresistible short stories. In Fly Away Alone, she plays a sensuous songbird; Dos/Chin, which also happens to be the name of her mischievous robotic dog, finds Yuki exploring her artistic side; A Life is a meditative piece where Yuki reflects on happier times; in fully-fledged Matrix mode, Comet The Thief stars our idol as a mischievous martial-arts bandit; The Mirror explores the darker side of Yuki as she is mysteriously followed by images of herself that seem to emerge from mirrors; and in Lazy Gui, our scantily-clad heroine embarks on a race against time as her Space Freighter is set for self-destruct.\n\nIncludes two awesome bonuses: the music video of Yuki's smash hit, My Dearest You, and the incredible World War II air attack recreation, Project BB-11. Additional extras include The Making Of..., which explains the techniques and tricks used to create the state-of-the-art animation that gives life to this virtual megastar.\n\nWelcome to the worlds of Yuki Terai. Enter.. and your world will never be the same. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":151187,"type":"manga","name":"Libido: Kutsugi Kenichi Tanpenshuu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/151187/Libido__Kutsugi_Kenichi_Tanpenshuu"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":22561,"type":"anime","name":"Virtual Star 2000","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/22561/Virtual_Star_2000"},{"mal_id":49008,"type":"anime","name":"Yuki Terai Bonus Track: My Dearest You","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/49008/Yuki_Terai_Bonus_Track__My_Dearest_You"},{"mal_id":49009,"type":"anime","name":"Yuki Terai no Dancing Queen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/49009/Yuki_Terai_no_Dancing_Queen"},{"mal_id":50176,"type":"anime","name":"Cybervenus FeiFei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50176/Cybervenus_FeiFei"},{"mal_id":53508,"type":"anime","name":"Yuki Terai in Virtual Hawaii","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/53508/Yuki_Terai_in_Virtual_Hawaii"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
