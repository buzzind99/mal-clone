A string of droughts and other natural disasters tear the family apart, and Gusuko is forced to leave home and seek his fortunes on his own. Driven by a desire to improve the quality of life of his poor countrymen, he eventually joins a group of scientists called the Iihatov Volcano Department, and there takes part in scientific projects to fight the natural disasters that drove him from his home.\n\n(Source: pelleas.net)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":386,"type":"anime","name":"Animaruya","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/386/Animaruya"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":13215,"type":"anime","name":"Guskou Budori no Denki (2012)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/13215/Guskou_Budori_no_Denki_2012"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
