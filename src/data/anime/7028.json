The title is a reference to the sound of a passing train, as well as pop art. The animation won the second prize at the Zagreb Film Festival in Yugoslavia in 1974.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":377,"type":"anime","name":"Kuri Jikken Manga Kobo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/377/Kuri_Jikken_Manga_Kobo"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
