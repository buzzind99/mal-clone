Kidnapped by the school under the assumption that he prefers men, Kimito is made to be their \"commoner sample,\" exposing the girls to both commoner and man so that the transition to the world after school is not jarring. Threatened with castration should his sexual preferences not match the school's assumptions, Kimito keeps up the facade to protect his manhood.\n\nBut there are eccentric individuals around every corner who begin to make Kimito's life even more difficult. Among them are Aika Tenkuubashi, a social outcast who blurts out whatever comes to mind; Hakua Shiodome, a young genius; Karen Jinryou, the daughter of samurai who is obsessed with defeating Kimito; and Reiko Arisugawa, the perfect student who has delusions of marrying Kimito. Along with the commoner himself, these four girls make up the Commoner Club, which attempts to teach the girls more about life outside the school, while Kimito gradually learns about the odd girls surrounding him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2015,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"23:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 23:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":647,"type":"anime","name":"Memory-Tech","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/647/Memory-Tech"},{"mal_id":777,"type":"anime","name":"Showgate","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/777/Showgate"},{"mal_id":787,"type":"anime","name":"Happinet Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/787/Happinet_Pictures"},{"mal_id":843,"type":"anime","name":"BS Fuji","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"},{"mal_id":963,"type":"anime","name":"MAGES.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/963/MAGES"},{"mal_id":1554,"type":"anime","name":"Contents Seed","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1554/Contents_Seed"},{"mal_id":1582,"type":"anime","name":"Ichijinsha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1582/Ichijinsha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":300,"type":"anime","name":"SILVER LINK.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":51815,"type":"manga","name":"Ore ga Ojousama Gakkou ni \"Shomin Sample\" Toshite Rachirareta Ken","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/51815/Ore_ga_Ojousama_Gakkou_ni_Shomin_Sample_Toshite_Rachirareta_Ken"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":31797,"type":"anime","name":"Ore ga Ojousama Gakkou ni \"Shomin Sample\" Toshite Gets♥Sareta Ken Specials","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31797/Ore_ga_Ojousama_Gakkou_ni_Shomin_Sample_Toshite_Gets♥Sareta_Ken_Specials"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Ichizu Recipe (イチズレシピ)\" by Idol College"],"endings":["\"Twilight ni Kienaide (トワイライトに消えないで)\" by Yumi Hara"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-282008"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https://www.funimation.com/shows/shomin-sample"}]}}
