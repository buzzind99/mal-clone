As long as she can keep up her picture perfect facade, she will be able to accomplish her dream: to be loved by everyone and become the trophy wife of a billionaire.\n\nOn a day like any other, Hime slips down a flight of stairs and lands on top of Mai Mikoshiba, injuring the latter's arm. It turns out that Mai is the manager of a cafe, and the injury will make work impossible for her. It is decided that while Mai recovers, Hime will have to replace Mai at Café Liebe, which boasts an all-girls academy theme.\n\nDespite causing Mai's injury, Hime is accepted by the other staff members, with the exception of one girl who seems to hate her for reasons unknown. Hime becomes terrified that this girl has seen past her facade, which reminds her of a troubling event in her past. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1386,"type":"anime","name":"Infinite","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1386/Infinite"},{"mal_id":1582,"type":"anime","name":"Ichijinsha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1582/Ichijinsha"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":911,"type":"anime","name":"Passione","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/911/Passione"},{"mal_id":1813,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Lings","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1813/Studio_Lings"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":26,"type":"anime","name":"Girls Love","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/26/Girls_Love"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"Workplace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":104862,"type":"manga","name":"Watashi no Yuri wa Oshigoto desu!","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/104862/Watashi_no_Yuri_wa_Oshigoto_desu"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Himitsu♡Melody (秘密♡Melody)\" by Yui Ogura"],"endings":["\"Yume ga Samete mo (夢が覚めても)\" by Hime (CV: Yui Ogura), Mitsuki (CV: Sumire Uesaka)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
