Managed by the nefarious entertainment executive Ryou Tsukumo, they will stop at nothing to get their way, resorting to all kinds of underhanded tactics to bring down their rivals. TRIGGER's image has already been ruined by scandal, and IDOLiSH7 and Re:vale are headed for the same fate—or worse.\n\nMeanwhile, Zero, the legendary idol who disappeared 15 years ago, continues to haunt the present through those he left behind. His manager seems to be in contact with Tsukumo for his own schemes, and Zero's songwriter reveals himself in a letter after having been missing for years. IDOLiSH7 finds an ally in Re:vale to thwart ŹOOĻ's plans while trying to make sense of Zero's colleagues' actions, but it may be impossible for everyone to emerge unscathed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1103,"type":"anime","name":"TROYCA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1103/TROYCA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":61,"type":"anime","name":"Idols (Male)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/61/Idols_Male"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":45577,"type":"anime","name":"IDOLiSH7 Third Beat!","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/45577/IDOLiSH7_Third_Beat"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":53242,"type":"anime","name":"WONDER LiGHT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/53242/WONDER_LiGHT"},{"mal_id":54118,"type":"anime","name":"IDOLiSH7 Movie: LIVE 4bit - BEYOND THE PERiOD","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/54118/IDOLiSH7_Movie__LIVE_4bit_-_BEYOND_THE_PERiOD"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"WONDER LiGHT\" by IDOLiSH7"],"endings":["1: \"IMPERIAL CHAIN\" by ŹOOĻ (Eps 1, 3, 6-9, 11)","2: \"Negai wa shine on the sea\" by Ryuunosuke Tsunashi (CV: Takuya Satou) (eps 2)","3: \"Negai wa shine on the sea\" by TRIGGER (eps 4)","4: \"Dear Butterfly\" by MEZZO\" (eps 5)","5: \"Colorful\" by MEZZO\" (eps 10)","6: \"Mirai Notes wo Kanadete\" by Re:vale (eps 12)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://www.crunchyroll.com/"},{"name":"Aniplus TV","url":"http://www.aniplustv.com/"},{"name":"Bahamut Anime Crazy","url":"https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"},{"name":"Laftel","url":"https://laftel.net/"}]}}
