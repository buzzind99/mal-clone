It is covering my ordinary life as the snow covers the ground. Until then, I haven't noticed, what has stayed unchanged in my daily life, the familiar scenes that have always been there, the warmth of the person whom I haven't noticed that I love her. \n\nThey have existed to bind me in this world in order not to let me leave. \n\nIt is the moment when I begin look for the bind and the significant person, for the first time. The time goes, and the sun gradually begins to shine the season. I wonder where I will be, and who will grip my hand.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":130,"type":"anime","name":"CherryLips","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/130/CherryLips"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Arms","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/38/Arms"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":675,"type":"anime","name":"One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/675/One__Kagayaku_Kisetsu_e"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Kagayaku Kisetsu e\" by Rei Sakamoto"],"endings":["\"Shousetsu\" by Rei Sakamoto","\"The Gentle Magic\" by Rei Sakamoto"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
