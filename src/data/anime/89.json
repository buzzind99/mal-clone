Following in the footsteps of the long expired Principality of Zeon and the more recent Crossbone Vanguard, Zanscare rules over its subjects with cruelty, routinely using a large guillotine for public executions.\n\nLiving in Central Europe, space immigrant Üso Ewin joins the League Militaire, a militia made up of civilians frustrated with the Earth Federation's inability to combat the Zanscare Empire. Üso's latent abilities as a psychic Newtype awaken and allow him to pilot the Victory Gundam, the only mobile suit capable of holding off the elite BESPA forces of the Zanscare Empire.\n\nHoping to protect his best friend Shakti Kareen and locate his parents within the ranks of the Federation, Üso fights on with the Victory, striving to bring an end to the empire's reign.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1993,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"17:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 17:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"TV Asahi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"},{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":747,"type":"anime","name":"Apollon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/747/Apollon"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":116678,"type":"manga","name":"Kidou Senshi V Gundam","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/116678/Kidou_Senshi_V_Gundam"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":88,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam F91","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/88/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_F91"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":95,"type":"anime","name":"Turn A Gundam","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/95/Turn_A_Gundam"},{"mal_id":23259,"type":"anime","name":"Gundam: G no Reconguista","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/23259/Gundam__G_no_Reconguista"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":40464,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam: Hikaru Inochi Chronicle U.C.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/40464/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Hikaru_Inochi_Chronicle_UC"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Stand Up To The Victory\" by Tomohisa Kawasoe (eps 1-31)","2: \"Don't Stop Carry On\" by RD (eps 32-51)"],"endings":["1: \"Winners Forever\" by INFIX (eps 1-31)","2: \"Moichido Tenderness\" by KIX S (eps 32-51)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
