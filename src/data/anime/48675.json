When the sudden news is revealed to both of their families, their parents quickly devise a proposition with neither Nagi's nor Erika's knowledge: in order to restore them both to their rightful families and ensure everyone's happiness, the two should get engaged.\n\nWhen informed of this, Nagi and Erika are quick to reject the absurd plan, refusing to go along with their parents' wishes. But, with neither party willing to back down, only time can tell where their relationship will go.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"01:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 01:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"TV Asahi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":118,"type":"anime","name":"SynergySP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/118/SynergySP"},{"mal_id":247,"type":"anime","name":"Shin-Ei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":123602,"type":"manga","name":"Kakkou no Iinazuke","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/123602/Kakkou_no_Iinazuke"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":51738,"type":"anime","name":"Kakkou no Iikagen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/51738/Kakkou_no_Iikagen"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Dekoboko (凸凹)\" by Kiyoe Yoshioka","2: \"Glitter\" by sumika"],"endings":["1: \"Shikaku Unmei (四角運命)\" by Sangatsu no Phantasia","2: \"HELLO HELLO HELLO\" by Eir Aoi"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-282691"},{"name":"Animax Korea","url":"https://www.animaxtv.co.kr"},{"name":"Bilibili Global","url":"https://www.bilibili.tv/en/index"},{"name":"Laftel","url":"https://laftel.net/"}]}}
