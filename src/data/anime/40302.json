The pilot was rejected by Shirato himself (the original comic creator the film was based on) and the plan was changed to animate Ninpuu Kamui Gaiden instead, a side story to the Kamui Den manga also created by Shirato. Though with this change, Ooshima did not partake in Ninpuu Kamui Gaiden's production.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":489,"type":"anime","name":"TCJ","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/489/TCJ"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":5023,"type":"anime","name":"Ninpuu Kamui Gaiden","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5023/Ninpuu_Kamui_Gaiden"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":5232,"type":"anime","name":"Ninja Bugei-chou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5232/Ninja_Bugei-chou"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
