But she's so focused on reaching her goals that she's not prepared for the very different (and overwhelming) city life that awaits her in a Tokyo high school. Luckily, she makes fast friends with Shima Sousuke, a handsome classmate who's as laid-back as she is over-prepared. Can this naive country girl make it big in Tokyo with Sousuke by her side? \n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1671,"type":"anime","name":"DMM pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1671/DMM_pictures"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":132,"type":"anime","name":"P.A.
