But Utena's eyes seem to be fixed on one familiar face that stands out among the rest—Touga Kiryuu, Utena's childhood friend. Touga knows of Utena's past and possesses knowledge of the Mark of the Rose, a set of unique rings worn by those who compete for the hand of the Rose Bride. The Rose Bride, Himemiya Anthy, belongs to whomever wins her in a duel, and the one that wins all the duels is said to be given the power to bring revolution to the world. Utena is drawn into the duels, but Touga and their complicated history together may end up unraveling everything. Nothing is as it seems in this retelling of the original anime series.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1461,"type":"anime","name":"Audio Tanaka","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1461/Audio_Tanaka"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":284,"type":"anime","name":"Central Park Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":5,"type":"anime","name":"Avant Garde","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":26,"type":"anime","name":"Girls Love","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/26/Girls_Love"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":931,"type":"manga","name":"Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Adolescence Mokushiroku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/931/Shoujo_Kakumei_Utena__Adolescence_Mokushiroku"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":440,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo Kakumei Utena","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/440/Shoujo_Kakumei_Utena"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Fiancé ni Naritai\" by Mitsuhiro Oikawa"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Funimation","url":"https://www.funimation.com/shows/revolutionary-girl-utena-adolescence-of-utena"}]}}
