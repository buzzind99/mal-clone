Hearing about rumored Phoenix sightings in the Land of Fire, Himiko—the cruel queen of Yamatai obsessed with immortality—sends her army to conquer the nation and retrieve the creature. Young Nagi, his elder sister Hinaku, and her foreign husband Guzuri are the only survivors of the slaughter. But while Nagi is taken prisoner by the enemy, elsewhere, Hinaku has a shocking revelation. \n\nThe Resurrection\nIn a distant future where Earth has become uninhabitable, Leona undergoes surgery on a space station to recover from a deadly accident. However, while also suffering from amnesia, his brain is now half cybernetic and causes him to see people as formless scraps and robots as humans. Falling in love with Chihiro, a discarded robot, they escape together from the space station to prevent Chihiro from being destroyed. Yet as his lost memories gradually return, Leona will have to confront the painful truth about his past.\n\nThe Transformation\nYearning for independence, Sakon no Suke—the only daughter of a tyrant ruler—kills priestess Yao Bikuni, the sole person capable of curing her father's illness. Consequently, she and her faithful servant, Kahei, are unexpectedly confined to the temple grounds of Bikuni's sanctuary. While searching for a way out, Sakon no Suke assumes the priestess's position and uses a miraculous feather to heal all those reaching out for help.\n\nThe Sun\nAfter his faction loses the war, Prince Harima's head is replaced with a wolf's. An old medicine woman who recognizes his bloodline assists him and the wounded General Azumi-no-muraji Saruta in escaping to Wah Land. But their arrival at a small Wah village is met with unexpected trouble as Houben, a powerful Buddhist monk, wants Harima dead. With the aid of the Ku clan wolf gods that protect the village's surroundings, he survives the murder attempt. After tensions settle, Saruta uses his established reputation in Wah to persuade the villagers to welcome Harima into their community. Over a period of time, Harima becomes the village's respected leader under the name Inugami no Sukune. But while the young prince adapts to his new role, he must remain vigilant as new dangers soon arise and threaten his recently acquired tranquility. \n\nThe Future\nLife on Earth has gradually ceased to exist, with the survivors taking refuge in underground cities. To avoid human extinction, Doctor Saruta unsuccessfully tries to recreate life in his laboratory. However, the unexpected visit of Masato Yamanobe, his alien girlfriend Tamami, and his colleague Rock Holmes reveals a disturbing crisis: the computers that regulate the subterranean cities have initiated a nuclear war that will eliminate all of mankind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The 2004 Hi no Tori TV series adapts five of Osamu Tezuka's manga chapters into thirteen episodes; in no particular order, they are the first, second, sixth, 11th, and 12th chapters. The animators did not try to copy Tezuka's drawing style and instead opted for a more generic style of TV animation—slick and polished. An English version of the TV series was released by Anime Works in October 2007. In addition to being broadcast in high-definition, the anime's soundtrack features some of Tezuka's favorite music, such as Beethoven as well as the inclusion and usage of ancient Chinese instruments.","season":"spring","year":2004,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":111,"type":"anime","name":"NHK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"},{"mal_id":577,"type":"anime","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"},{"mal_id":595,"type":"anime","name":"NYAV Post","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/595/NYAV_Post"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":200,"type":"anime","name":"Tezuka Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/200/Tezuka_Productions"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1325,"type":"manga","name":"Hi no Tori (1967)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/1325/Hi_no_Tori_1967"}]},{"relation":"Spin-off","entry":[{"mal_id":2997,"type":"anime","name":"Hi no Tori: Houou-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2997/Hi_no_Tori__Houou-hen"},{"mal_id":2998,"type":"anime","name":"Hi no Tori: Uchuu-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2998/Hi_no_Tori__Uchuu-hen"},{"mal_id":2999,"type":"anime","name":"Hi no Tori: Yamato-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2999/Hi_no_Tori__Yamato-hen"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":23659,"type":"anime","name":"Hi no Tori: Hagoromo-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/23659/Hi_no_Tori__Hagoromo-hen"},{"mal_id":23675,"type":"anime","name":"Hi no Tori: Kizuna-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/23675/Hi_no_Tori__Kizuna-hen"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"'Hi no Tori' Opening Theme\" by Min Chen, Mio Isayama & The Czech Philharmonic Orchestra"],"endings":["\"Hi no Tori\" by Mika Nakashima"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-278877"}]}}
