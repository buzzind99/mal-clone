However, she is saved because the president himself offers her a job (some sort of a secret mission). Milk-chan answers the phone to receive missions from The President by saying something like \"Hello, Bank of Hokkaido. Just kidding!\"\n\nAfter getting her mission, Milk-chan and her sidekicks take off aboard the \"Milk-6\" helicopter to go on her mission. Did I tell you this is a spoof of 1970s spy thrillers or some sort of Bond movies?\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":"summer","year":1998,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Not scheduled once per week"},"producers":[{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":122,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/122/Tokyo_Kids"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1769,"type":"anime","name":"Oh!
