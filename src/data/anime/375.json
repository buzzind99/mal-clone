In opposition to this plan are the slightly nutty Kyuusaku Natsume and Nuku Nuku, the android who acts as a companion to his young son. Nuku Nuku's classmates are all eccentrics, Futaba, the class president, is a domineering control-freak, who cannot leave her authority in school. Chieko Shirakaba is the rich snob with the two yes-girls who always take her side. There is a bookworm, a mystic, a scientist, and a pop singer. All of these are true to their descriptions: the mystic is always foretelling doom via tarot cards, spirits, or some other occult technique. The pop singer never says anything except as a song. The bookworm always has her nose in a book. These eccentricities add to the series' humor. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"winter","year":1998,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiko Advertising","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":242,"type":"anime","name":"Ashi Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/242/Ashi_Productions"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":76571,"type":"manga","name":"Shin Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume: Tanjou-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/76571/Shin_Bannou_Bunka_Neko-Musume__Tanjou-hen"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":373,"type":"anime","name":"Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/373/Bannou_Bunka_Neko-Musume"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":3232,"type":"anime","name":"Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume Specials","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3232/Bannou_Bunka_Neko-Musume_Specials"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Fine Colorday\" by Megumi Hayashibara"],"endings":["\"Oyasuminasai Ashita wa Ohayou\" by Megumi Hayashibara"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
