One of the foremost of the pilots is the cocky teenager Yamamoto Yohko, and during one of her missions, she and her crew are sucked into a temporal anomaly (a la Star Trek) that sends her back to our time. Amnesiac, she only thinks of herself as a typical high school student - until a course of events sends her back to her ship the TA-29, with her newfound friends fighting at her side in a war that looks suspiciously like an arcade game (complete with 100 yen ignition costs!). \n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"09:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 09:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":87368,"type":"manga","name":"Soreyuke!
