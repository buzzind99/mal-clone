Momokitchi Momoi, an underworld boss and the owner of a professional team known as the \"Peach Twisters,\" seems to be the perfect example. There is only one punishment for players who have let him down: death. Terrible as he may sound, there is someone even more wicked than him—his daughter, Momomi.\n\nThe three members of the Danger Service Agency—Mikura Suzuki, Tomohisa Harada, and Kenichi Kurokawa—are tasked with kidnapping Momokitchi and taking down his criminal empire. Surrounded by armed bodyguards, he is bound to be a risky target. However, born with a gun in hand, Mikura is used to dancing with danger. The only unknown quantity is Momomi, reputed to be a cold-blooded killer with a twisted mind. Should she stand in the DSA's way, Suzuki might finally find herself a worthy opponent.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":152,"type":"anime","name":"Green Bunny","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/152/Green_Bunny"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"},{"mal_id":813,"type":"anime","name":"SoftCel Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/813/SoftCel_Pictures"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Arms","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/38/Arms"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":222,"type":"anime","name":"Mezzo DSA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/222/Mezzo_DSA"}]},{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":320,"type":"anime","name":"A Kite","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/320/A_Kite"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
