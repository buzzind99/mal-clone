However, peace is shattered when the EMPIRE begins to use forbidden magic. These dark powers cause dimensional rifts around the world and once again plunge Earth into chaos and warfare.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":116,"type":"anime","name":"Broccoli","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/116/Broccoli"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1474,"type":"anime","name":"Synch-Point","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1474/Synch-Point"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1224,"type":"anime","name":"Aquarian Age: Sign for Evolution","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1224/Aquarian_Age__Sign_for_Evolution"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Change My Heart (Qwerty Mix)\" by Yoko Takahashi"],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
