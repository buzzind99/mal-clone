The story focuses on a small hamlet plagued by monster attacks and living under the shadow of rule by Count Magnus Lee, a powerful vampire lord who has ruled the land for thousands of years. When a young girl is bitten by the Count and chosen as his current plaything, she seeks out help of a quiet wandering stranger, D. It so happens that D is one of the world's best vampire hunters, and he takes it upon himself to cut through Magnus Lee's many minions, and put an end to the Count's rule.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Ajia-Do","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/30/Ajia-Do"},{"mal_id":80,"type":"anime","name":"Trans Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/80/Trans_Arts"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":177,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Kyuuma","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/177/Studio_Kyuuma"},{"mal_id":1479,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Core","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1479/Studio_Core"},{"mal_id":1480,"type":"anime","name":"CBS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1480/CBS"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"},{"mal_id":1447,"type":"anime","name":"Urban Vision","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1447/Urban_Vision"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":196,"type":"anime","name":"Production Reed","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/196/Production_Reed"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":32,"type":"anime","name":"Vampire","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1360,"type":"manga","name":"Vampire Hunter D","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/1360/Vampire_Hunter_D"},{"mal_id":3988,"type":"manga","name":"Vampire Hunter D","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/3988/Vampire_Hunter_D"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":543,"type":"anime","name":"Vampire Hunter D (2000)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/543/Vampire_Hunter_D_2000"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Your Song\" by TM NETWORK"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
