This brutal attack becomes infamous as the \"The Day the Angel Fell\", and marks the beginning of humanity's war for survival. \n\nThe series begins in A.G. 108 when the UE attack the space colony Ovan, where Flit Asuno lives with his mother. Flit's mother is killed by the UE, and in her belongings (in an object called a \"AGE Device\") he discovers the blueprints for a powerful weapon from the past - the ancient messiah named \"Gundam.\" \n\nFrom these blueprints, Flit spends the next several years studying engineering at an Earth Federation base on the Nora space colony and designing the AGE-1 Gundam. Seven years later, in A.G. 115, Flit completes the Gundam, just as the UE attack Nora. Flit and his lineage's battle piloting the AGE-1 to protect mankind is about to begin. \n\n(Source: GoodAnime.net)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2011,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":30861,"type":"manga","name":"Mobile Suit Gundam AGE: Story of the Beginning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/30861/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_AGE__Story_of_the_Beginning"},{"mal_id":35319,"type":"manga","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam AGE: First Evolution","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/35319/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_AGE__First_Evolution"},{"mal_id":35321,"type":"manga","name":"Mobile Suit Gundam AGE: Second Evolution","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/35321/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_AGE__Second_Evolution"},{"mal_id":42441,"type":"manga","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam AGE: Climax Hero","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/42441/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_AGE__Climax_Hero"},{"mal_id":47248,"type":"manga","name":"Mobile Suit Gundam AGE: Final Evolution","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/47248/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_AGE__Final_Evolution"},{"mal_id":91706,"type":"manga","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam AGE","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/91706/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_AGE"}]},{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":80,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/80/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":17655,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam AGE: Memory of Eden","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/17655/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_AGE__Memory_of_Eden"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Asu e (明日へ)\" by Galileo Galilei (eps 1-15)","2: \"sharp #\" by Negoto (eps 16-28)","3: \"REAL\" by ViViD (eps 29-29)","4: \"AURORA\" by Aoi Eir (eps 40-49)"],"endings":["1: \"Kimi no Naka no Eiyuu (君の中の英雄)\" by Minami Kuribayashi (eps 1-15)","2: \"My World\" by SPYAIR (eps 16-28)","3: \"WHITE justice\" by Faylan (eps 29-29)","4: \"Forget-me-not ~Wasurenagusa~ (forget-me-not 〜ワスレナグサ〜)\" by FLOWER (eps 40-49)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
