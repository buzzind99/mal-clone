With germs, bacteria, and foreign substances abound, the jobs of various cells become increasingly difficult and dangerous. As some of the unfortunate ones who matured in this chaotic environment, Sekkekkyuu AA2153 and Hakkekkyuu U-1196 strive to fulfill their duties—even if it means seeing many of their fellow cells lose their lives in duty.\n\nSet in an environment vastly different from its parent story, Hataraku Saibou Black portrays the cells' struggles as they try to maintain the body's health. However, the human's condition continues to deteriorate, and whether or not these efforts will amount to something concrete depends on the cells!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":2146,"type":"anime","name":"NetEase","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2146/NetEase"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":839,"type":"anime","name":"LIDENFILMS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Anthropomorphic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"},{"mal_id":56,"type":"anime","name":"Educational","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/56/Educational"},{"mal_id":67,"type":"anime","name":"Medical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/67/Medical"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":114638,"type":"manga","name":"Hataraku Saibou Black","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/114638/Hataraku_Saibou_Black"}]},{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":37141,"type":"anime","name":"Hataraku Saibou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37141/Hataraku_Saibou"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":41531,"type":"anime","name":"Hataraku Saibou Black CM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/41531/Hataraku_Saibou_Black_CM"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Hashire! with Seiya Yamasaki (Kyusonekokami) (走れ！ with ヤマサキセイヤ（キュウソネコカミ）)\" by Hiroyuki Hayashi (Polysics) (ハヤシヒロユキ（POLYSICS）)"],"endings":["\"Ue wo Muite Hakobou with Sekkekkyuu & Hakkekkyuu (上を向いて運ぼう with 赤血球・白血球)\" by Hiroyuki Hayashi (Polysics) (ハヤシヒロユキ（POLYSICS）)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Funimation","url":"https://www.funimation.com/shows/cells-at-work-code-black"},{"name":"Netflix","url":"https://www.netflix.com/"},{"name":"Bahamut Anime Crazy","url":"https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"},{"name":"Bilibili","url":"https://www.bilibili.com/"},{"name":"Viu","url":"https://www.hq.viu.com/"},{"name":"Wakanim","url":"https://www.wakanim.tv/"},{"name":"iQIYI","url":"https://www.iq.com/"}]}}
