This time, however, for the purpose to protect the driver from a possible accident, the new car is equipped with a safety system called \"Safety Seven\" with seven guarding devices. Also, it is loaded with the engine \"X\" that miraculously survived the tragic accident. Now its driver is Go, younger brother of Kenichi, who is determined to succeed to his brother`s will.
