Attracted by her cute charms, all he wishes for is that she would look at him with those beautiful eyes beneath her glasses. But just a few days after making her acquaintance, Kaede notices something different about Ai: her eyes are squinting and her glasses are missing. Nonetheless, he still finds her adorable!\n\nUnexpectedly, Ai has a tendency to forget her glasses. Having terrible vision, she has difficulty going through her day at school.
