Exams are forgotten and homework is neglected as she pursues her life-long dream of becoming a pro-wrestling champion. Ayane has what it takes - skill, determination, and a lethal \"high-kick\" - even a cool wrestling mask! But who will guide her to the top?\n\nEnter Kunimitsu Tangay: a veteran trainer who is prepared to mold young Ayane into a championship caliber fighter. But his rigorous regimen isn't preparing her for wrestling... but for kickboxing instead! Feeling betrayed, Ayane is furious when Kunimitsu enters in a kickboxing tournament. But Ayane's school ABSOLUTELY FORBIDS such violent extracurricular activities. What will she do when Sakurako Miyagawa, the top contender of the All Japan Kickboxing League, challenges her to a duel? Will she be able to high-kick her way to victory - or will she get kicked out of school?\n\n(Source: U.S. Manga Corps)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":513,"type":"anime","name":"Nikkatsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/513/Nikkatsu"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":284,"type":"anime","name":"Central Park Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":253,"type":"anime","name":"Rikuentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/253/Rikuentai"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":54,"type":"anime","name":"Combat Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/54/Combat_Sports"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":["\"Fight For Yourself\" by The Street Beats"],"endings":["\"Aoi Kaze no Mukou ni (蒼い風の向こうに)\" by Yuuko Miyamura"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
