The animation mixes wartime footage, family photographs and pop imagery, much of which is seen through fusuma-like grids that cut apart the image and distance it from the viewer. The soundtrack includes a haunting heartbeat, sounds of sirens and Robert Plantâ€™s moans. The title refers to a campaign ran during the war by a confectionary company that asked children to submit crayon drawings of their brand icon, an angel, which had a profound emotional impact on Tanaami as a child.\n\n(Source: Collaborative Cataloging Japan)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":5,"type":"anime","name":"Avant Garde","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
