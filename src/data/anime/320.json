Corrupt and immoral, they train the girl to become a weapon, dangling the promise of vengeance in front of the hapless orphan. From celebrities and politicians to influential businessmen, Sawa is tasked with assassinating targets selected arbitrarily by her crooked overseers. She executes every mission without fail, and her distinctive weapon has become infamous among the city's police officers.\n\nPhysically abused by Akai, who is no more righteous than her victims, Sawa begins to dream of a life unhindered by the shadow of her \"guardians.\" One day, Sawa meets Oburi, a fellow orphan and vigilante. They quickly form a bond born of desperation and disgruntlement at the unjust world, envisioning a future free from the stain of murder.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"This OVA has been released in three versions: a censored version; a \"director's cut,\" with an extra fifteen minutes of footage; and the original \"uncut\" version, which remains uncensored. The uncut version contains graphic sexuality and graphic nudity, which led to the OVA in its original state getting banned in many countries.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":152,"type":"anime","name":"Green Bunny","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/152/Green_Bunny"},{"mal_id":1139,"type":"anime","name":"BEAM Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1139/BEAM_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Arms","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/38/Arms"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":221,"type":"anime","name":"Mezzo Forte","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/221/Mezzo_Forte"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":3323,"type":"anime","name":"Kite Liberator","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3323/Kite_Liberator"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
