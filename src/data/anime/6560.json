In a world where anything seems possible, there is no telling what will happen next during this eccentric spectacle.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Popee the Performer's 11th episode was banned from being rebroadcast on Kids Station in Japan due to complaints about excessive violence in a children's show.
