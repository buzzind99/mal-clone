After seeing his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, and fighting Joseph's friend Muhammad Abdul, Jotaro learns that the \"Spirit\" is actually Star Platinum, his Stand, or fighting energy given a semi-solid form. Later, his mother gains a Stand, and becomes sick. Jotaro learns that it is because the vampire Dio Brando has been revived 100 years after his defeat to Jonathan Joestar, Jotaro's great-great-grandfather. Jotaro decides to join Joseph and Abdul in a trip to Egypt to defeat Dio once and for all.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1364,"type":"anime","name":"Super Techno Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1364/Super_Techno_Arts"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"APPP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/77/APPP"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":32,"type":"anime","name":"Vampire","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":872,"type":"manga","name":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/872/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_3__Stardust_Crusaders"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":666,"type":"anime","name":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/666/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":14719,"type":"anime","name":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken (TV)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/14719/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_TV"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":20899,"type":"anime","name":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/20899/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_3__Stardust_Crusaders"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Funimation","url":"https://www.funimation.com/shows/jojos-bizarre-adventure"}]}}
