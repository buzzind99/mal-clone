To avoid darkening the \"color\" of friends and family, she pays attention, reads the atmosphere, and tells lies to conceal the situation.\n\nTotsuko ends up forming a band with a girl with beautiful colors and a boy who loves music after finding herself in a second-hand bookstore in a remote part of the city. Three overly delicate people gather and begin to play youth.\n\n(Source: MAL News)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":245,"type":"anime","name":"Toho","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/Toho"},{"mal_id":1956,"type":"anime","name":"STORY","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1956/STORY"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1591,"type":"anime","name":"Science SARU","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1591/Science_SARU"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
