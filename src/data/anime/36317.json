And he'll tell you from firsthand experience that the job of a bookstore employee is more challenging than it may seem to the average customer.\n\nAlongside his equally eccentric coworkers, Honda constantly deals with the stressful requirements of the bookselling industry. From the drama of receiving new titles without their bonus material to the struggle of providing quality service to customers who speak a different language, the work of a skeleton bookseller never ends.\n\nNevertheless, despite the hardships he faces, Honda thoroughly enjoys his job and strives to bring the best book selections and service to his customers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":213,"type":"anime","name":"Half H.P Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/213/Half_HP_Studio"},{"mal_id":354,"type":"anime","name":"Encourage Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/354/Encourage_Films"},{"mal_id":1631,"type":"anime","name":"Radio Osaka","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1631/Radio_Osaka"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":1786,"type":"anime","name":"Muse Communication","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1786/Muse_Communication"},{"mal_id":1840,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1840/Bandai_Namco_Arts"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":276,"type":"anime","name":"DLE","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/276/DLE"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":69,"type":"anime","name":"Otaku Culture","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture"},{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"Workplace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":104337,"type":"manga","name":"Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/104337/Gaikotsu_Shotenin_Honda-san"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":38527,"type":"anime","name":"Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san OVA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38527/Gaikotsu_Shotenin_Honda-san_OVA"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":38632,"type":"anime","name":"Honda-san x Taka no Tsume","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38632/Honda-san_x_Taka_no_Tsume"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"ISBN ~Inner Sound & Book's Narrative~\" by TECHNOBOYS PULCRAFT GREEN-FUND feat.
