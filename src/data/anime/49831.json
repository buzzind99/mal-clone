In the hope of winning the war, a group of three highly skilled human warriors is assembled, known as the guardians of humanity.\n\nEmpress, the last surviving guardian, wakes up alone in an empty research facility. Unable to recall anything from the past except a place called \"Lighthouse No. 8,\" she begins to search for answers. It is not long before she discovers an impending threat from Artemis—and she is the sole person who can save the world from destruction.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Black★★Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall was released on Blu-ray in four volumes from July 27, 2022 to October 28, 2022.","season":"spring","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1261,"type":"anime","name":"Good Smile Company","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1261/Good_Smile_Company"},{"mal_id":2135,"type":"anime","name":"Imagine","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2135/Imagine"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1722,"type":"anime","name":"Bibury Animation Studios","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1722/Bibury_Animation_Studios"},{"mal_id":2325,"type":"anime","name":"Bibury Animation CG","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2325/Bibury_Animation_CG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":11285,"type":"anime","name":"Black★Rock Shooter (TV)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/11285/Black★Rock_Shooter_TV"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"ASEED\" by ZAQ"],"endings":["\"Before the Nightmare\" by Kanako Takatsuki"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Disney+","url":"https://www.disneyplus.com/"}]}}
