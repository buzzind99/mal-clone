Bandai Namco announced it was a sequel to Tales of the Rays and streamed the video on their official YouTube channel.\n\nThe game and videos star new characters Ickx Neve and Mileena Weiss along with a cast of returning characters from other Tales of games.\n\nIn a nontraditional manner, no new game app will be created, rather the current game app will receive a massive update and discontinue the main story line and start anew (several years later in-story) resetting the game play for all users. The story is said to take a darker tone.\n\nThe game's production was announced in 2015 and the official launch is expected some time later this year.\n\n(Source: ANN, edited)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1097,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Games","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1097/Bandai_Namco_Games"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":858,"type":"anime","name":"Wit Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/858/Wit_Studio"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Strategy Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":391,"type":"anime","name":"Tales of Phantasia The Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/391/Tales_of_Phantasia_The_Animation"},{"mal_id":445,"type":"anime","name":"Tales of Eternia The Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/445/Tales_of_Eternia_The_Animation"},{"mal_id":1731,"type":"anime","name":"Tales of Symphonia The Animation: Sylvarant-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1731/Tales_of_Symphonia_The_Animation__Sylvarant-hen"},{"mal_id":4884,"type":"anime","name":"Tales of the Abyss","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4884/Tales_of_the_Abyss"},{"mal_id":30911,"type":"anime","name":"Tales of Zestiria the Cross","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/30911/Tales_of_Zestiria_the_Cross"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":36955,"type":"anime","name":"Tales of the Rays Gekijou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36955/Tales_of_the_Rays_Gekijou"},{"mal_id":39067,"type":"anime","name":"Tales of the Rays: Everlasting Destiny","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39067/Tales_of_the_Rays__Everlasting_Destiny"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
