The political marriage is arranged to strengthen the alliance between both countries, but the future queen is deeply unsatisfied with her fate being decided for her. Upon arrival in the country, Marie Antoinette is acquainted with Oscar Fançois de Jarjayes—Commander of the Royal Guard.\n\nDue to her father's desire for a son, Oscar is raised as a boy with an expectation to inherit his title as The Commander. Though she is revered by both men and women alike, Oscar cannot help but desire to live life as a woman instead of masquerading as a man. As Oscar reluctantly serves the young, spoiled queen, the growing resentment and suffering of the poor become harder for her to ignore—especially when Marie Antoinette frivolously spends her wealth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1979,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1003,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Television Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":65,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo Movie Shinsha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/65/Tokyo_Movie_Shinsha"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":660,"type":"manga","name":"Versailles no Bara","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/660/Versailles_no_Bara"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":3868,"type":"anime","name":"Versailles no Bara: Seimei Aru Kagiri Aishite","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3868/Versailles_no_Bara__Seimei_Aru_Kagiri_Aishite"},{"mal_id":7861,"type":"anime","name":"Versailles no Bara to Onna-tachi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/7861/Versailles_no_Bara_to_Onna-tachi"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":5415,"type":"anime","name":"La Rose de Versailles","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5415/La_Rose_de_Versailles"},{"mal_id":52967,"type":"anime","name":"Versailles no Bara (Movie)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/52967/Versailles_no_Bara_Movie"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Bara wa Utsukushiku Chiru\" by Hiroko Suzuki"],"endings":["\"Ai no Hikari to Kage\" by Hiroko Suzuki"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
