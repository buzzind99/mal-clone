Meanwhile, an upcoming chorus recital proves to be another opportunity for Sasame Tsuji to progress further in her endeavor to befriend Youko.\n\nKoukyuu Wagyuu no Shishokukai\nOn their way home from school, Youko, Futaba, and Hayama are interrupted by Yuu Takezono. The pompous young boy quickly tries to pull Youko away from her friends to ask if she can assist him in his studies. While Yuu is elated when Youko agrees to help, the seemingly normal interaction spurs Sakura Usuda to take action and recapture his attention. \n\nOn a different day, Mitsugu Yamaji's frantic worries about Youko and her job at Shino Sonobe's patisserie lead him to recount a Christmas incident involving the former maid.\n\nDekiru Onna wa Mebunryou\nDuring a group cooking assignment, Futaba guides Hayama, Asako Kondou, and Serina Nishiyama through the process of making cookies from scratch. The simple snack, however, is not enough to satisfy Futaba's gluttonous appetite.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Sansha Sanyou Specials was bundled with the Blu-ray and DVD release of Sansha Sanyou volumes one to three.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":95,"type":"anime","name":"Doga Kobo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/95/Doga_Kobo"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":20140,"type":"manga","name":"Sansha Sanyou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/20140/Sansha_Sanyou"}]},{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":31564,"type":"anime","name":"Sansha Sanyou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31564/Sansha_Sanyou"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
