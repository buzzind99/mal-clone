However, achieving this goal appears to be harder than expected, as everyone in his surroundings often fails to notice him due to his lack of presence. In fact, Shiraishi's lack of presence is so severe that people think his seat in class is always empty, and mistakenly assume that he often skips school. There is even a weird rumor spreading around in class, claiming that those who successfully spot Shiraishi will be blessed with good fortune for the day.\n\nSo far, the only person who notices his existence is Nagisa Kubo, the girl seated next to him. Unfortunately for him though, Kubo likes to tease him on a daily basis and often puts him into unprecedented and nerve-wracking situations. However, as Kubo's playful antics continue to involve the reluctant Shiraishi, he may soon discover that his youth might not be as boring as he initially thought. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"21:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 21:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1255,"type":"anime","name":"Glovision","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1255/Glovision"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":1414,"type":"anime","name":"bilibili","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1414/bilibili"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1295,"type":"anime","name":"Pine Jam","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1295/Pine_Jam"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":122448,"type":"manga","name":"Kubo-san wa Mob wo Yurusanai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/122448/Kubo-san_wa_Mob_wo_Yurusanai"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Dramatic ja Nakute mo (ドラマチックじゃなくても)\" by Kana Hanazawa"],"endings":["\"Kasuka de Tashika (かすかでたしか)\" by DIALOGUE+"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https://www.hidive.com/"},{"name":"Animax Asia","url":"https://www.animax-asia.com/"},{"name":"Aniplus TV","url":"http://www.aniplustv.com/"},{"name":"Bahamut Anime Crazy","url":"https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"},{"name":"Bilibili Global","url":"https://www.bilibili.tv/en/index"},{"name":"Laftel","url":"https://laftel.net/"}]}}
