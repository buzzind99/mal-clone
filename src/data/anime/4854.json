Now, its rival academy Seishikan is on a mission to assimilate all other schools, and Hakuo Academy is its next target. Supported by the fearsome Yasha clan, Seishikan students frequently visit Hakuo's campus to assault and forcibly convince their best students and athletes to transfer to Seishikan.\n\nDesperate to preserve their legacy, Hakuo Academy enlists the help of Kojirou Fuuma—the only member of the once-legendary Fuuma clan still living in their ancestral village. Kojirou will stop at nothing to defend Hakuo against the Yasha clan, whom the family has feuded with for generations. But will that be enough to stop Seishikan's aggression?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":155,"type":"anime","name":"animate Film","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/155/animate_Film"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":14230,"type":"manga","name":"Fuuma no Kojirou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/14230/Fuuma_no_Kojirou"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":4855,"type":"anime","name":"Fuuma no Kojirou: Seiken Sensou-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4855/Fuuma_no_Kojirou__Seiken_Sensou-hen"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Don't Go Away\" by Night Hawks"],"endings":["\"Good-Bye Marry\" by Night Hawks"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
