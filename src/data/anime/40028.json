However, just as all seems well for the two cadets, their peace is suddenly shaken by the arrival of Eren Yeager and the remaining members of the Survey Corps.\n\nHaving finally reached the Yeager family basement and learned about the dark history surrounding the Titans, the Survey Corps has at long last found the answer they so desperately fought to uncover. With the truth now in their hands, the group set out for the world beyond the walls.\n\nIn Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season, two utterly different worlds collide as each party pursues its own agenda in the long-awaited conclusion to Paradis' fight for freedom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season adapts content from volumes 23-28 of Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga.","season":"winter","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"00:10","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 00:10 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"},{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1499,"type":"anime","name":"Techno Sound","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1499/Techno_Sound"},{"mal_id":1557,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon Enterprise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1557/Pony_Canyon_Enterprise"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":569,"type":"anime","name":"MAPPA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Survival","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/76/Survival"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":23390,"type":"manga","name":"Shingeki no Kyojin","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/23390/Shingeki_no_Kyojin"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":38524,"type":"anime","name":"Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38524/Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":48583,"type":"anime","name":"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season Part 2","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/48583/Shingeki_no_Kyojin__The_Final_Season_Part_2"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":49627,"type":"anime","name":"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season Specials","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/49627/Shingeki_no_Kyojin__The_Final_Season_Specials"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":51241,"type":"anime","name":"20-pun de Oitsukeru: Shingeki no Kyojin","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/51241/20-pun_de_Oitsukeru__Shingeki_no_Kyojin"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":51618,"type":"anime","name":"Boku no Sensou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/51618/Boku_no_Sensou"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Boku no Sensou (僕の戦争)\" by Shinsei Kamattechan (神聖かまってちゃん)"],"endings":["\"Shougeki (衝撃)\" by Yuuko Andou (安藤裕子)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-254209"},{"name":"Netflix","url":"https://www.netflix.com/title/70299043"}]}}
