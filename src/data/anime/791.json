Their lives are peaceful until the day Arion's uncle Hades appears and lures him to the underworld, promising that there is a way to restore his mother's sight. To achieve this, Arion must kill the god who cursed her: Zeus, the king of Olympus.\n\nAfter years of training in the underworld, Arion—now a deadly warrior—embarks on his vengeful quest to slay Zeus. On his journey to Mount Olympus, Arion forges alliances with some unlikely individuals: the giant Geedo, the thief Seneca, and the mute maiden Resphoina. As he cuts a bloody path through a vast world of warring armies and mythical monsters, Arion begins to unravel the secrets of his lineage and the fate of the scheming gods.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":382,"type":"anime","name":"Tokuma Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/382/Tokuma_Shoten"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":23777,"type":"manga","name":"Arion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/23777/Arion"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Pegasus no Shoujo (ペガサスの少女)\" by Kyouko Gotou"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
