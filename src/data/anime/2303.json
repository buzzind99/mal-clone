In \"The Rolling Colony Affair,\" a colony is hosting a cabaret show featuring the girls of Gundam.

A parody of the videogame RPG genre, \"Gundam Legend\" has Amuro, Kamille and Judau sent on a perilous quest to rescue the princess of the Zeta Kingdom from Char Aznable and his vicious Zeon MS forces. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":2302,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi SD Gundam Mk-I","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2302/Kidou_Senshi_SD_Gundam_Mk-I"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":2305,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi SD Gundam Mk-III","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2305/Kidou_Senshi_SD_Gundam_Mk-III"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Planet Zone\" by Risa Yuuki"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
