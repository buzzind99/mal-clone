Police chronicles the tales of Mega-Tokyo's special police division designed to control rogue Boomers in the city. A.D. Police Officer Kenji Sasaki faces a major dilemma: he loses another partner to a rabid boomer. A day after he's sent off-duty, he receives a new partner in the form of German cop Hans Kleif. Funny thing is that Kenji sucker-punched Hans at a bar the night before. Not only does Kenji face the everyday task of controlling Boomers, he has to learn to adjust with his new partner. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"01:45","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 01:45 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":107,"type":"anime","name":"Plum","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/107/Plum"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":568,"type":"anime","name":"Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/568/Bubblegum_Crisis_Tokyo_2040"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1346,"type":"anime","name":"AD Police","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1346/AD_Police"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":1350,"type":"anime","name":"Parasite Dolls","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1350/Parasite_Dolls"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Imaginary Girl\" by Infix"],"endings":["\"Toki no Naka de\" by Masha"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
