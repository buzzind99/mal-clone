The victor of this contest becomes the Shaman King and the only one who is able to contact and control the Great Spirit, allowing them to reshape the world as they please through its immense power.\n\nDuring a late night walk, Manta Oyamada runs into his classmate, the carefree You Asakura, who invites him to come stargazing with some friends, who, to Manta's horror, turn out to be ghosts from a local cemetery! However, the knowledge that Manta possesses—a rare sixth sense that allows Manta to see these spirits—endears the boy to You. So when You finds out that his new comrade has been beaten up by a local gang, he decides to avenge him with the help of Amidamaru, a samurai ghost whose tomb was broken by the gang leader. \n\nSoon Manta uncovers more about the world of spirits, including the Shaman Fight, in which his new friend You aims to claim victory.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2001,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"18:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 18:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":717,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/717/TV_Tokyo_Music"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":252,"type":"anime","name":"4Kids Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/252/4Kids_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Xebec","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"manga","name":"Shaman King","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/50/Shaman_King"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":3861,"type":"anime","name":"Shaman King Specials","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3861/Shaman_King_Specials"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":42205,"type":"anime","name":"Shaman King (2021)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/42205/Shaman_King_2021"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Over soul\" by Megumi Hayashibara (eps 1-34)","2: \"Northern Lights\" by Megumi Hayashibara (eps 35-64)"],"endings":["1: \"Trust You\" by Megumi Hayashibara (eps 1-34)","2: \"Omokage (おもかげ)\" by Megumi Hayashibara (eps 35-63)","3: \"Tamashii Kasanete (魂魄重ねて)\" by Yuuko Satou (eps 64)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Netflix","url":"https://www.netflix.com/"}]}}
