Unfortunately, despite scoring well in the written exams, she only manages to barely pass her practicals. With no real world skills to speak of, her hopes of graduating are dismal—until she is offered an opportunity to join the mysterious team \"Tomoshibi\" and partake in an Impassable Mission.\n\nExcited by the prospect of working with the elite, Lily enthusiastically accepts. However, she is struck dumb when she arrives at Kagerou Palace and the true purpose of Tomoshibi and its hopeless situation comes into light. Joined by other problematic female spies along with a mysterious young man spearheading the operation, Lily realizes that this is not the ideal escapade she had pictured. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":1680,"type":"anime","name":"BS NTV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1680/BS_NTV"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":91,"type":"anime","name":"feel.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/91/feel"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":125340,"type":"manga","name":"Spy Kyoushitsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/125340/Spy_Kyoushitsu"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Tomoshibi (灯火)\" by nonoc"],"endings":["\"Secret Code\" by Konomi Suzuki"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https://www.hidive.com/"},{"name":"Animax Korea","url":"https://www.animaxtv.co.kr"},{"name":"Anime Digital Network","url":"https://animedigitalnetwork.fr/"},{"name":"Bilibili Global","url":"https://www.bilibili.tv/en/index"},{"name":"Laftel","url":"https://laftel.net/"}]}}
