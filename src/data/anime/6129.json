The kind-hearted Marin, intent on returning it to its owner, drags a reluctant Urin along with her to the sky world despite reminders of a turtle elder who left for the surface and never returned. After locating the ring's owner, Kanon Miyamori, they learn that Kanon had tossed it into the sea after her boyfriend dumped her earlier that day.\n\nThough Marin insists that such a lovely item should not be thrown away, Kanon discards it once again. As they search for the ring, Urin becomes separated from the other two and accidently breaks the seal on a stone coffin, releasing an evil being known as Sedna. Sensing Sedna's release, the formerly missing turtle elder, Matsumoto, reveals himself to Kanon and her companions, naming Marin as the Priestess of the Sea. Together with the Priestess of the Sky, she has the power to seal Sedna away again. And as luck would have it, during an encounter with one of Sedna's minions, Kanon discovers that she is the Priestess of the Sky. Though Kanon is hesitant, she and Marin decide to work together to save the world from the evil that threatens it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2009,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"01:29","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 01:29 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":218,"type":"anime","name":"Zexcs","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/218/Zexcs"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":20821,"type":"manga","name":"Umi Monogatari: Anata ga Ite Kureta Koto","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/20821/Umi_Monogatari__Anata_ga_Ite_Kureta_Koto"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":6883,"type":"anime","name":"Umi Monogatari: Anata ga Ite Kureta Koto - Shinjiau Kokoro","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6883/Umi_Monogatari__Anata_ga_Ite_Kureta_Koto_-_Shinjiau_Kokoro"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":9100,"type":"anime","name":"Umi Monogatari: Marin no Kore Naani?","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9100/Umi_Monogatari__Marin_no_Kore_Naani"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":10306,"type":"anime","name":"Umi Monogatari: Kanon to Iku Amamikoshima","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10306/Umi_Monogatari__Kanon_to_Iku_Amamikoshima"}]},{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":33910,"type":"anime","name":"Marine Bloomin'","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33910/Marine_Bloomin"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"violet\" by marble"],"endings":["\"Toumei na Inori\" by Masumi Itou"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-272597"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https://www.funimation.com/shows/umi-monogatari"}]}}
