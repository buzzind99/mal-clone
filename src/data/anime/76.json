The next day, the ferret cries out to her telepathically, asking Nanoha to save him. The ferret reveals himself to be Yuuno Scrya, a mage from another world who is trying to collect the dangerous 21 Jewel Seeds that he accidentally scattered across the world. He enlists Nanoha's help, gifting her the magical wand Raising Heart, and teaches her how to become a powerful mage.\n\nDays later, after reclaiming a few of the Jewel Seeds, another mage appears: Fate Testarossa. Stronger than Nanoha, Fate refuses to divulge her reasons in trying to collect the Jewel Seeds. Nanoha senses a melancholy in her eyes, but Fate refuses to communicate. Directed by Akiyuki Shinbo, Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha is a story about the clash of emotions when goals collide.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2004,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":92,"type":"anime","name":"Starchild Records","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/92/Starchild_Records"},{"mal_id":313,"type":"anime","name":"Omnibus Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/313/Omnibus_Japan"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Seven Arcs","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/35/Seven_Arcs"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":23223,"type":"manga","name":"Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/23223/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/77/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_As"}]},{"relation":"Spin-off","entry":[{"mal_id":176,"type":"anime","name":"Triangle Heart: Sweet Songs Forever","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/176/Triangle_Heart__Sweet_Songs_Forever"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":4985,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 1st","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4985/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha__The_Movie_1st"},{"mal_id":12101,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: Lyrical Toy Box","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12101/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha__Lyrical_Toy_Box"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Innocent Starter\" by Nana Mizuki"],"endings":["\"Little Wish ~lyrical step~\" by Tamura Yukari"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
