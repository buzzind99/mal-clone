However, as revealed in her diary, she was always hiding both her pain and her true feelings for Prince Siegward. While she keeps this locked away, an evil witch ultimately possesses her, leading to her demise—a tragic end for the tsundere villainess. This is how the story always goes, an end coded into the game MagiKoi.\n\nBroadcasting club members Aoto Endou and Shihono Kobayashi decide to play this game. In another universe, Prince Siegward hears their voices, believing it to be a divine revelation from a god and goddess. These voices clue him into something he never noticed before: Liselotte is actually overwhelmingly adorable!\n\nThere are no resets in this game, and just one chance to change the future for the ill-fated villainess. In years to come, these two entities, who would guide the country to prosperity and greatness, would be known as play-by-play Endou and color commentator Kobayashi! \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:55","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:55 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":1542,"type":"anime","name":"DMM.com","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1542/DMMcom"},{"mal_id":1585,"type":"anime","name":"Nichion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1585/Nichion"},{"mal_id":1590,"type":"anime","name":"FuRyu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1590/FuRyu"},{"mal_id":1671,"type":"anime","name":"DMM pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1671/DMM_pictures"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":2074,"type":"anime","name":"Bit grooove promotion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion"},{"mal_id":2111,"type":"anime","name":"Pia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2111/Pia"},{"mal_id":2146,"type":"anime","name":"NetEase","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2146/NetEase"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":200,"type":"anime","name":"Tezuka Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/200/Tezuka_Productions"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Video Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/79/Video_Game"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":134989,"type":"manga","name":"Tsundere Akuyaku Reijou Liselotte to Jikkyou no Endou-kun to Kaisetsu no Kobayashi-san","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/134989/Tsundere_Akuyaku_Reijou_Liselotte_to_Jikkyou_no_Endou-kun_to_Kaisetsu_no_Kobayashi-san"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":53958,"type":"anime","name":"Kobayashi-san no Tsundere Kouza","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/53958/Kobayashi-san_no_Tsundere_Kouza"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Ibitsu na Kotoba (イビツナコトバ)\" by DAZBEE"],"endings":["\"Hana no You ni (花のように)\" by Anna"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https://www.hidive.com/"},{"name":"Anime Digital Network","url":"https://animedigitalnetwork.fr/"},{"name":"Aniplus TV","url":"http://www.aniplustv.com/"},{"name":"Bilibili Global","url":"https://www.bilibili.tv/en/index"},{"name":"Laftel","url":"https://laftel.net/"}]}}
