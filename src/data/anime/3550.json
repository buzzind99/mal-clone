Compared to other thoroughbred horses, he looks more like a donkey with wide nostrils; however, with his guts and speed as his weapon, Makibao wins in every big race.\n\nIn the beginning of his career, Makibao had a trouble making his debut as a racehorse, because of his appearance and various disadvantages he had. But Makibao had reasons to overcome his difficulties; there was a lifelong rival horse called Superhorse Cascade, that Makibao needed to defeat. Plus, he was determined to win back his mother, a horse that had been taken away for pay back the debt on the farm.\n\nThere are many hardships that Makibao has to overcome, but he thrives in the series of races to become a great racehorse.\n\n(Source: pierrot.jp)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1996,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"06:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 06:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Racing","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":26125,"type":"manga","name":"Midori no Makibao","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/26125/Midori_no_Makibao"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Hashire Makibao (Gen Kyoku \"Hashire Koutarou\") (走れマキバオー(原曲「走れコウタロー」))\" by Tatsuya Aoshima, 前田伸夫, F Map, Masaharu Miyake, Kenji Fukui"],"endings":["\"Tottemo Uma Nami (とってもウマナミ)\" by Men's 5"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
