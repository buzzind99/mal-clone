Van is the prince from the now-defunct Revbahaf Kingdom, Kona – his hand maiden, and Sian – his philosopher and tutor.  Chased by enemies, these three individuals earn the kindness of Aaron, who feeds them at the cabin.  By helping out with Aaron’s chores, the former royal family learns to live a peaceful life getting by, rather than plotting a revenge on the neighboring country which invaded them. Together they try to rebuild the Kingdom of Revbahaf. \n\n(Source: Manhwa101)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":937,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Kaab","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/937/Studio_Kaab"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":["\"I'm Ready (준비됐어)\" by SLAM"],"endings":["\"Goodbye 영원한건 아니야 (Goodbye doesn't mean forever)\" by SLAM"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
