Nobita names it Fuuko. Eventually, he, Doraemon and their friends take it to a vast countryside through the Anywhere Door. There, they learn about the Wind and Storm Villages, and Fuuko's real identity. Soon, Nobita and his friends have to protect Fuuko from the Storm Village and a now-possessed Nobuo, who is being controlled by the spirit of the Storm Village's former leader. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":247,"type":"anime","name":"Shin-Ei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":12471,"type":"manga","name":"Daichouhen Doraemon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/12471/Daichouhen_Doraemon"}]},{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":2471,"type":"anime","name":"Doraemon (1979)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2471/Doraemon_1979"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Doraemon no Uta\" by Satoko Yamano"],"endings":["\"Mata aeru hi made (またあえる日まで)\" by Yuzu"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
