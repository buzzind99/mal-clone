In a nightmarish necropolis where nothing is as it seems, vengeance comes in the form of a living Death's-Head! \n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"02:45","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 02:45 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Universal Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/31/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Diomedéa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/51/Diomed%C3%A9a"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Bones","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":4617,"type":"manga","name":"Kaiki Romanesque Gekiga: Skull Man","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/4617/Kaiki_Romanesque_Gekiga__Skull_Man"},{"mal_id":153948,"type":"manga","name":"Skull Man","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/153948/Skull_Man"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Hikari no Machi\" by TOKIO"],"endings":["\"Ashita wa Ashita no Kimi ga Umareru (明日は明日の君が生まれる)\" by Chocolove from AKB48"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https://www.hidive.com/tv/the-skull-man"}]}}
