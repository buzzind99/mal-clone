The world is enveloped with a black forest and people have become infected with a pathogen that causes them to burst into flame in the presence of natural fire. The only safe source of fire can be obtained by hunting black beasts, Flame Spirits, which reside deep in the forest. Among the fire hunters, rumors of \"The King of Fire Hunters\" began spreading recently—an individual who would be able to harvest the man-made star, the millennium comet that once wandered the void.\n\nThe story revolves around Touko, a village-raised girl, and Koushi, a former student in the capital. The encounter between the two, who were not supposed to cross paths, will change the fate of the world.\n\n(Source: MAL News)","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"},{"mal_id":33,"type":"anime","name":"WOWOW","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/33/WOWOW"},{"mal_id":464,"type":"anime","name":"flying DOG","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1278,"type":"anime","name":"Signal.MD","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1278/SignalMD"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":155043,"type":"manga","name":"Hikari no Ou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/155043/Hikari_no_Ou"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Usotsuki (嘘つき)\" by Leo Ieiri (家入レオ)"],"endings":["\"Mada Tooku ni Iru (まだ遠くにいる)\" by Maaya Sakamoto (坂本真綾)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://www.crunchyroll.com/"},{"name":"Aniplus TV","url":"http://www.aniplustv.com/"},{"name":"Bahamut Anime Crazy","url":"https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"},{"name":"Laftel","url":"https://laftel.net/"}]}}
