The music video was released on November 3, 2016 on IA Project's official YouTube channel and advertises the film's release at the end. It was also included on the DVD/BD release of Kagerou Daze: In a Day's but lacks the advertisement. The body of the music video is a mash up of the whole franchise, ideally giving the viewer a refresher before the film's release the next day.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":21603,"type":"anime","name":"Mekakucity Actors","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/21603/Mekakucity_Actors"},{"mal_id":30913,"type":"anime","name":"Mekakucity Days","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/30913/Mekakucity_Days"},{"mal_id":33219,"type":"anime","name":"Kagerou Daze: In a Day's","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33219/Kagerou_Daze__In_a_Days"},{"mal_id":34318,"type":"anime","name":"Mekakucity V's","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34318/Mekakucity_Vs"},{"mal_id":35752,"type":"anime","name":"Otsukimi Recital","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/35752/Otsukimi_Recital"},{"mal_id":36494,"type":"anime","name":"Mekakucity Records","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36494/Mekakucity_Records"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
