In the old days they'd go off into the country and hack each other up with swords, but these days, what with school, that isn't very practical.\n\nSo some of them do something very un-Japanese. They strap on a big bike, roar around annoying people, and pound anyone they consider dishonorable.\n\nNow meet Eguchi Yousuke, leader of a high-school Biker gang AND the school's handicrafts club. Which means he divides his time between fistfights and fancy needlework.\n\nAnd if you think he's weird, wait until you meet the rest of his gang...\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":310,"type":"anime","name":"AnimEigo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/310/AnimEigo"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"Delinquents","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/55/Delinquents"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":36133,"type":"manga","name":"Shonan Bakusouzoku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/36133/Shonan_Bakusouzoku"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Let's Go Nice Knight (Let's go nice騎士(ナイト))\" by Shou","2: \"Black Board Jungle\" by Hound Dog","3: \"Aa Shounan (アーア湘南)\" by Yousuke Eguchi"],"endings":["1: \"Shounan Bakusouzoku (湘南暴走族)\" by Shou","2: \"Aoi Emblem (青いエンブレム)\" by Gakuro","3: \"10 Ounce no Bible (10オンスのバイブル)\" by Hironobu Kageyama","4: \"True Heart\" by Ammy","5: \"Dreamer and Screamer\" by Loudness","6: \"Monologue (モノローグ)\" by Kiyotaka Sugiyama","7: \"Blue\" by Ritsuko Tanaka (田中律子)","8: \"Ude no Naka no Eien (腕の中の永遠)\" by Mana","9: \"Niji no Anata e (虹の彼方へ)\" by Mr.Children","10: \"Sunao ga Ii yo ne (素直がいいよね)\" by JUNCA","11: \"Change\" by Kiyomi Kobayashi (小林清美)","12: \"Seed of Future\" by Kiyotaka Sugiyama"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
