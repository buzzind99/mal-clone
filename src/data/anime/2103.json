GASP is a upcoming band known for its violence, struggling to be noticed against the popularity of hotshot Aikawa, who's #1 on the charts and beloved by his fans. The Yaon Hibiya concert represents GASP's mainstream debut to break out of the small-time club scene, which is threatened by the schemes of Aikawa's manager, Ms. Kato of Koyama Productions. Kato wants To-Y to leave that \"bunch of hoodlums,\" and sing independently for a major label. \n\nAdding to the confusion is an unexplained character who manifests feline traits, named Niya. Niya presents herself as \"To-Y's aijin\" (\"Niya, To-Y no aijin da yo!\") to the consternation of Koishikawa Hiderou, who has interest in To-Y. Koishikawa, also known as \"Sonoko-chan,\" is typed as a \"okama\" by Niya. A running motif is GASP, it's fans, and associates regarded as unusual by the mainstream public, as exemplified by their musical taste, dress, and Classic Coke-drinking, which only contributes to more difficulty in their struggle to be accepted.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1480,"type":"anime","name":"CBS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1480/CBS"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Gallop","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/36/Gallop"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":24531,"type":"manga","name":"TO-Y","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/24531/TO-Y"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Lemon no Yuuki\" by Psy-S"],"endings":["\"CUBIC LOVERS\" by Psy-S"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
