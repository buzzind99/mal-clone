Gokuu happens to be in possession of a dragon ball, but unfortunately for Bulma, he refuses to part ways with it, so she makes him a deal: he can tag along on her journey if he lets her borrow the dragon ball's power. With that, the two set off on the journey of a lifetime.\n\nThey don't go on the journey alone. On the way, they meet the old Muten-Roshi and wannabe disciple Kuririn, with whom Gokuu trains to become a stronger martial artist for the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament. However, it's not all fun and games; the ability to make any wish come true is a powerful one, and there are others who would do much worse than just wishing for a boyfriend. To stop those who would try to abuse the legendary power, they train to become stronger fighters, using their newfound strength to help the people around them along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Adapts the first 194 chapters of Akira Toriyama’s Dragon Ball manga.","season":"winter","year":1986,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":2278,"type":"anime","name":"Harmony Gold","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2278/Harmony_Gold"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"manga","name":"Dragon Ball","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/42/Dragon_Ball"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":502,"type":"anime","name":"Dragon Ball Movie 1: Shen Long no Densetsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/502/Dragon_Ball_Movie_1__Shen_Long_no_Densetsu"},{"mal_id":891,"type":"anime","name":"Dragon Ball Movie 2: Majinjou no Nemurihime","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/891/Dragon_Ball_Movie_2__Majinjou_no_Nemurihime"},{"mal_id":892,"type":"anime","name":"Dragon Ball Movie 3: Makafushigi Daibouken","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/892/Dragon_Ball_Movie_3__Makafushigi_Daibouken"},{"mal_id":893,"type":"anime","name":"Dragon Ball Movie 4: Saikyou e no Michi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/893/Dragon_Ball_Movie_4__Saikyou_e_no_Michi"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":813,"type":"anime","name":"Dragon Ball Z","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/813/Dragon_Ball_Z"},{"mal_id":6033,"type":"anime","name":"Dragon Ball Kai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6033/Dragon_Ball_Kai"}]},{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":2222,"type":"anime","name":"Dr. Slump: Arale-chan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2222/Dr_Slump__Arale-chan"},{"mal_id":30450,"type":"anime","name":"Dr. Slump: Hoyoyo!
