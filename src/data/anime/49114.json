Suspecting that the Beast is a curse-bearing vampire, Vanitas primarily aims to heal it using the powers of his grimoire.\n\nAlong the way, the two get separated and suddenly travel back to the past—to the exact moment the Beast is lurking in the woods. After a battle against the gigantic wolf and a vampire hunter, Vanitas decides to team up with Jeanne in order to find Noé. Despite being allies, Jeanne's goal is the opposite of Vanitas', as she was tasked to kill the Beast—suspecting it may be someone she used to know.\n\nMeanwhile, a severely wounded Noé is picked up by the mysterious Chloé d'Apchier and her servant. Like Noé, Chloé is a vampire whose existence was erased from the public's knowledge. She has been a guardian for future generations and once tried to find a way to become human again. While Noé is grateful to Chloé for her hospitality, little does he know that she might be siding with forces far more dangerous than the Beast itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":1333,"type":"anime","name":"Hakuhodo DY Music & Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1333/Hakuhodo_DY_Music___Pictures"},{"mal_id":1554,"type":"anime","name":"Contents Seed","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1554/Contents_Seed"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Bones","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":32,"type":"anime","name":"Vampire","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":93753,"type":"manga","name":"Vanitas no Karte","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/93753/Vanitas_no_Karte"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":48580,"type":"anime","name":"Vanitas no Karte","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/48580/Vanitas_no_Karte"},{"mal_id":50768,"type":"anime","name":"Vanitas no Karte: En Route Pour le Gévaudan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50768/Vanitas_no_Karte__En_Route_Pour_le_Gévaudan"},{"mal_id":50770,"type":"anime","name":"Vanitas no Karte: Le Chemin Parcouru Depuis la Rencontre","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50770/Vanitas_no_Karte__Le_Chemin_Parcouru_Depuis_la_Rencontre"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Your Name\" by Little Glee Monster"],"endings":["\"salvation\" by Mononkul (モノンクル)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-282139"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https://www.funimation.com/shows/the-case-study-of-vanitas"},{"name":"AIS Play","url":"https://aisplay.ais.co.th/portal/"},{"name":"Aniplus Asia","url":"https://www.aniplus-asia.com/"},{"name":"Aniplus TV","url":"http://www.aniplustv.com/"},{"name":"Bahamut Anime Crazy","url":"https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"},{"name":"Bilibili","url":"https://www.bilibili.com/"},{"name":"Hulu","url":"https://www.hulu.com/"},{"name":"Laftel","url":"https://laftel.net/"},{"name":"Wakanim","url":"https://www.wakanim.tv/"},{"name":"iQIYI","url":"https://www.iq.com/"}]}}
