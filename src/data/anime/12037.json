Richard Kimble is now a veterinarian on the lam (lamb?), running from a false conviction for a murder committed by \"a man with overbite.\" Despite the omnipresent danger, he must stoop and intervene whenever he sees a cat (always Michael) suffering; after treating the patient, he plays a trick on the cat and runs away. (He's a fugitive, after all.) Another sketch draws parallels between wandering husbands and wandering house cats, who seem to have similar proclivities. Two more point out what happens when a cat's instincts run up against the requirements of baseball or pro wrestling.\n\n(Source: Orphan Fansubs)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":99,"type":"anime","name":"Kitty Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/99/Kitty_Films"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2256,"type":"anime","name":"Kitty Film Mitaka Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2256/Kitty_Film_Mitaka_Studio"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":71,"type":"anime","name":"Pets","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/71/Pets"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":3160,"type":"manga","name":"What's Michael?","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/3160/Whats_Michael"}]},{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":12005,"type":"anime","name":"What's Michael?","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12005/Whats_Michael"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Call My Name (コールマイネーム)\" by Shouko Minami"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
