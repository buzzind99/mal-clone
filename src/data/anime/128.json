A.E.G.I.S is all but dismantled now and has become an underground organization consisting of only a few Gate Keepers left to save humanity. One of the members, Ayane Isuzu, is sick of society as a whole, though she continues to defeat the Invaders out of spite for her father. Suddenly, she learns of the revival of Machine General (Kikai Shogun) and Devil Count (Akuma Hakushaku), but a mysterious ghost girl now accompanies them. It is up to Ayane and the remnants of A.E.G.I.S to stop them and save humanity once again.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Gonzo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3/Gonzo"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Gate Keepers","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/127/Gate_Keepers"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Haoto (羽音)\" by Junko Watanabe (eps 1-3)","2: \"Kyou, Egao ga Areba (今日、笑顔があれば)\" by Sakura Nogawa (eps 4-5)"],"endings":["1: \"Kyou, Egao ga Areba (今日、笑顔があれば)\" by Sakura Nogawa (eps 1-3,6)","2: \"Haoto (羽音)\" by Junko Watanabe (eps 4-5)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
