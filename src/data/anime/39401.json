His little sister gets impatient and leaves without him. She is too young to know where the shop is and she gets lost. The boy then runs off to look for his lost sister and almost gets hit by a driver, which was Mario. He gets out and gives him a small lecture on being safe when crossing the road.\n\n(Source: Super Mario Wiki)","background":"Super Mario no Koutsuu Anzen is a Toei produced public service announcement released in 1989 based on Super Mario Bros. 3 for use in schools across Japan. The video was released on two formats; both VHS and 16mm film. Super Mario no Koutsuu Anzen is still used across Japanese schools today.
