His job as the head of the Izumo Group's youth gang kept him pleasantly occupied with yakuza wars, mahjong and assassinations...

Forever changed, Kubota becomes entangled with a drifter named Minoru Tokito, and the two form an unlikely companionship that draws them deeper into the mystery of Wild Adapter...\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":61,"type":"anime","name":"Frontier Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"},{"mal_id":1195,"type":"anime","name":"Creators in Pack","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1195/Creators_in_Pack"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":521,"type":"anime","name":"Anpro","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/521/Anpro"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":573,"type":"manga","name":"Wild Adapter","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/573/Wild_Adapter"}]},{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":425,"type":"anime","name":"Shiritsu Araiso Koutougakkou Seitokai Shikkoubu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/425/Shiritsu_Araiso_Koutougakkou_Seitokai_Shikkoubu"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Hyouryuusha (漂流者)\" by Toshiyuki Morikawa & Hideo Ishikawa"],"endings":["\"Kaleidoscope (カレイドスコープ)\" by Toshiyuki Morikawa & Hideo Ishikawa"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
