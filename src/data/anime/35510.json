She proceeds to indiscriminately take out Darkness Whales members with weapons that stink of blood. The protagonists are three boy classmates of Kurumi who watch the entire thing while not really doing anything.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":1574,"type":"anime","name":"Quaras","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1574/Quaras"},{"mal_id":1590,"type":"anime","name":"FuRyu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1590/FuRyu"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1229,"type":"anime","name":"Pie in the sky","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1229/Pie_in_the_sky"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"},{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":38175,"type":"anime","name":"Seizei Ganbare!
