Cube Town is an isolated small coastal village with such features as an art museum, beach, lighthouse (which has the number 36 above its entrance) and canal. It is located adjacent to Crescent Bay surrounded by the Rookery Mountains coastal range and served by regular ships (including a weekly freighter) that deliver mail, foodstuffs and other supplies plus occasional tourists from a nearby large metropolis named Cubic City. The heights above it lead into Glacier Valley which is snowbound even during summer. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2002,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiko Advertising","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"},{"mal_id":215,"type":"anime","name":"Nelvana","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/215/Nelvana"},{"mal_id":398,"type":"anime","name":"Milky Cartoon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/398/Milky_Cartoon"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
