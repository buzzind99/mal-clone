Neo-Zeon, the third faction in the war formerly known as Axis Zeon, remains as powerful as ever. Led by Newtype Haman Karn, Neo-Zeon has been implementing plans to take over both Earth and the space colonies.\n\nThe AEUG flagship Argama heads to the Side 1 colony Shangri-La for repairs. Living in the colony is Judau Ashta, a 14-year-old junk dealer who is struggling to make enough money to put his younger sister through school. Upon the discovery of an escape pod containing a former Titans pilot, Judau and his friends are quickly led to the Argama in hopes of stealing a mobile suit which they can sell for a fortune. However, with the arrival of a Neo-Zeon ship seeking to defeat the Argama, Judau and his friends are dragged into to a conflict that will bring them across space and Earth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1986,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"17:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 17:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":1366,"type":"anime","name":"Nagoya Broadcasting Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1366/Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":16168,"type":"manga","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam ZZ","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/16168/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_ZZ"},{"mal_id":85393,"type":"manga","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam ZZ","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/85393/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_ZZ"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":85,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi Zeta Gundam","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/85/Kidou_Senshi_Zeta_Gundam"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":87,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam: Gyakushuu no Char","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/87/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Gyakushuu_no_Char"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":9708,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam ZZ: Gundam Frag.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9708/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_ZZ__Gundam_Frag"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":14007,"type":"anime","name":"Akai Shouzou: Char, Soshite Frontal e","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/14007/Akai_Shouzou__Char_Soshite_Frontal_e"},{"mal_id":24371,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam Unicorn: Episode EX - Hyakunen no Kodoku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/24371/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_Unicorn__Episode_EX_-_Hyakunen_no_Kodoku"},{"mal_id":40464,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam: Hikaru Inochi Chronicle U.C.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/40464/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Hikaru_Inochi_Chronicle_UC"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Anime Ja Nai: Yume wo Wasureta Furui Chikyuujin yo (アニメじゃない-夢を忘れた古い地球人よ-)\" by Masato Arai (eps 1-25)","2: \"Silent Voice (サイレント・ヴォイス)\" by Jun Hiroe (eps 26-47)"],"endings":["1: \"Jidai ga Naiteiru (時代が泣いている)\" by Masato Arai (eps 1-25)","2: \"Issenmannen Ginga (一千万年銀河)\" by Jun Hiroe (eps 26-47)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-282867"}]}}
