Not knowing their names or even how to speak, cars crashed, planes dropped from the sky, and society crumbled in an instant. One young man happens to wander into a military testing facility, where he meets Johnny, a young boy who underwent experimental memory enhancement treatment and could, therefore, still remember who he was. Johnny names the young man Wataru and teaches him everything that he can before his frail body fails him.\n\nWataru sets out on a journey to see if he can find other people like him, and in San Francisco, he meets a mysterious silver-haired woman named Sophia, who refuses to speak about her past. Sophia says that she is heading to New York, and decides to travel together with Wataru. As the pair make their way across America, they learn about what has happened to the rest of society, and what the essence of humanity really is.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":342,"type":"anime","name":"Japan Home Video","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/342/Japan_Home_Video"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":284,"type":"anime","name":"Central Park Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"},{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":5,"type":"anime","name":"Avant Garde","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":21156,"type":"manga","name":"Kaze no Na wa Amnesia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/21156/Kaze_no_Na_wa_Amnesia"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"True Love\" by Akemi and Takashi Tsushimi"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-273483"}]}}
