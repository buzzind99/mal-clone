Following a clash between the fathers of Inuyasha and Menoumaru, the weapon is the only means to restore Menoumaru his rightful family heritage.\n\nHowever, upon ambushing Inuyasha, Menoumaru discovers that Tessaiga's owner alone can wield it. Determined to achieve his objective regardless, he kidnaps Kagome to force Inuyasha to use his blade and release the sealed powers of the Hyouga clan. With their dependable companions' assistance, Inuyasha and Kagome oppose Menoumaru, unaware that his sinister intentions and alarming potential will endanger not only their world but also its distant future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The first of four movies with original storylines, InuYasha Movie 1: Toki wo Koeru Omoi premiered between the release of the TV series' episodes 54 and 56. The character designer was different from the one who handled the TV series, resulting in the characters' modeling more closely to the manga's creator Rumiko Takahashi's art style. In Japan, there were two DVD releases: one on August 21, 2002 and another on November 26, 2004. The first included a bonus CD with an original audio drama titled Inuyasha - Toki wo Koeru Mou Hitotsu no Omoi, while the second was a standard edition single disc. The English version was made available by Viz Media on September 7, 2004. Comic adaptations of the film were also published by Shogakukan and Viz Media. The former released each of the two volumes on August 1, 2002 and September 18, 2002, respectively. The latter issued both on January 1, 2005.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"},{"mal_id":78,"type":"anime","name":"Time Travel","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/78/Time_Travel"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":249,"type":"anime","name":"InuYasha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/249/InuYasha"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"No More Words\" by Ayumi Hamasaki"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-278859"},{"name":"Netflix","url":"https://www.netflix.com/"}]}}
