To keep Her Highness focused, Lord Shogun bans all sweets in the town of Edo. Meanwhile, tensions arise between two powerful factions: the Mizutani group, led by the respected Shizuku \"Ane-san\" Mizutani; and the Yoshida group, under the leadership of the capricious Haru \"Harunosuke\" Yoshida. \n\nAne-san tirelessly tries to make contact with Harunosuke to deliver the news of the founding of a new temple school. But soon after she meets him by chance, romance blooms between the two. However, not everyone approves of this development—and they might stop at nothing to prevent their happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun: Tonari no Gokudou-kun was bundled with the limited edition 12th volume of the manga.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/112/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":14227,"type":"anime","name":"Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/14227/Tonari_no_Kaibutsu-kun"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
