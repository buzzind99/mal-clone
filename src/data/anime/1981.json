Upon developing the camera's film, she is shocked to find herself photographed alongside an unknown man. Enlisting the help of Kiwako's older brother, the three find out something even more troubling: the camera model has yet to be released. In turn, Mayumi becomes obsessed with discovering the origin of the peculiar camera and its mysterious photograph.\n\nFile 538\nAirplanes have been vanishing from the sky! Even stranger, rumor has it that the disappearing aircraft have been turning into giant carp. Meanwhile, a freelance detective investigates a run-down apartment on the outskirts of town, where he finds a middle-aged man and a young girl with a penchant for fish. Unable to identify the two, the investigator enters their room, only to find it empty save for a document that reads, \"This story has been prepared for you, my successor... who should be visiting this room in due time.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Twilight Q aired on Animax in August 2007, 20 years after its original release. Initially a means of showcasing young directors in anime, the series was cancelled after only two episodes. Both episodes had entirely different staffs and were produced separately from one another. Nevertheless, some of the staff, including Kazunori Ito, Akemi Takada, and Mamoru Oshii, would go on to form Headgear, a group of writers and artists that would ultimately create the widely successful Patlabor science-fiction franchise.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Ajia-Do","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/30/Ajia-Do"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["1: \"Rifurekushon (リフレクション; Reflection)\" by Mako Hyoudou (eps 1)","2: \"Guutara na Sakana (ぐうたらな魚; Lazy Fish)\" by Mako Hyoudou (eps 2)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
