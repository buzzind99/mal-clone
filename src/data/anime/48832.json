Neither character is great at interacting with members of the opposite genderâ€”Ryou is somewhat of an otaku and defenseless against women, and Ami does not have a good impression of 3D men. After a fateful encounter, the story follows the two as they learn to navigate a sea of interpersonal relationships and come to better understand the bitter and sweet aspects of modern relationships.\n\n(Source: MAL News)","background":"Director Masanao Kawajiri implements the use of rotoscoping as a technique to animate the film, filming the actors, and then drawing over the live-action film.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":141,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Video","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/141/Toei_Video"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
