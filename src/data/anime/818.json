She later turns out to be his cousin who he barely remembers from his childhood. Urara, who had felt something special for him (an other-than-cousinly-love), invites Touma to live with her since he has no place to stay other than the hotel room. Before taking the test, Touma meets Meiko Yotsuba, a beautiful, sophisticated woman also trying to get into Keio. Meiko gets into Keio but Touma does not, due to a cold Urara had given him shortly before. Although he did not make it, he pretends he does to earn the respect of Meiko. Touma is caught up in a love triangle with Urara and Meiko, while struggling to keep Meiko believing he's really a Keio student and still be there for Urara at the same time. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":99,"type":"anime","name":"Kitty Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/99/Kitty_Films"},{"mal_id":210,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Tulip","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/210/Studio_Tulip"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":44,"type":"anime","name":"Shaft","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/44/Shaft"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Love Polygon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/64/Love_Polygon"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1603,"type":"manga","name":"Sakura Tsuushin","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/1603/Sakura_Tsuushin"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Kimi no Mado Kara (From Your Window)\" by Takako Kuwata"],"endings":["\"Koi wa Kaze ni Notte (恋は風に乗って)\" by Takako Kuwata"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
