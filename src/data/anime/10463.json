One day, after setting a new high score of over nine hundred million in his favorite game, he happens upon an advertisement for a new game called \"Expers.\" The game promises both amazing gameplay and a chance of winning the affection of the beautiful Princess Atover, so Hiroshi signs up to play.\n\nThe next day, Hiroshi is at school when a mysterious capsule crashes into his classroom, within it containing Princess Atover herself! She gives Hiroshi a powered suit that grants enhanced abilities and tells him that he is the main character of a video game, naming him \"Zenon.\" Unfortunately, in order to win, Hiroshi must defeat all of his opponents—other players with a desire to become the \"main character\" of the game. Will Hiroshi be able to survive this deadly game and uncover its true nature?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Fantasia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/24/Studio_Fantasia"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Dreaming Fantasy\" by Ammy"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
