One day, Faria, a successor of the Seven Knights, saves an ordinary boy named Nemo from the forces of Destruction.\n\nDuring the ensuing battle, Nemo summons the power of a hero and becomes a successor as well. However, Nemo's hero is a stranger that is unknown to history, and so an epic journey where the past and present collide begins. \n\n(Source: Crunchyroll, edited)","background":"Based on the Seven Knights smartphone role-playing game by Netmarble.","season":"spring","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":211,"type":"anime","name":"Rakuonsha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/211/Rakuonsha"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":839,"type":"anime","name":"LIDENFILMS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS"},{"mal_id":1380,"type":"anime","name":"domerica","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1380/domerica"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":["\"Freeze (フリーズ)\" by flumpool"],"endings":["\"Tail\" by Daiki Yamashita (山下大輝)","2: \"Towa no Hana (永久ノ花(とわのはな))\" by Nemo (CV: Daiki Yamashita) & Faria (CV: Hibiku Yamamura) (eps 12)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-281166"},{"name":"Bahamut Anime Crazy","url":"https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"},{"name":"Bilibili","url":"https://www.bilibili.com/"},{"name":"Muse Asia","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGbshtvS9t-8CW11W7TooQg"}]}}
