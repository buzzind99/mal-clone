Through perseverance and hard work, his dream of starting his own apothecary and peaceful life in the countryside finally came true. Abruptly, Red gets a live-in partner and assistant named Rit—the princess of Duchy Loggervia and an adventurer herself—who gives everything up to join him.\n\nAlthough honest, kind, and loved by all, Red has a secret shared only with Rit: his real name is Gideon, brother of Ruti Ragnason, the \"Hero\" and a former member of her party. Ares Drowa, the \"Sage,\" kicked Red out of their party after their war against the Demon Lord after deciding he was weak and insignificant. Now, even though Red has left the Hero's party behind by assuming a new life together with Rit, his past has yet to let go of him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":323,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Columbia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1680,"type":"anime","name":"BS NTV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1680/BS_NTV"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":2545,"type":"anime","name":"KBS Kyoto","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2545/KBS_Kyoto"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1693,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Flad","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1693/Studio_Flad"},{"mal_id":2052,"type":"anime","name":"Wolfsbane","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2052/Wolfsbane"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":114279,"type":"manga","name":"Shin no Nakama ja Nai to Yuusha no Party wo Oidasareta node, Henkyou de Slow Life suru Koto ni Shimashita","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/114279/Shin_no_Nakama_ja_Nai_to_Yuusha_no_Party_wo_Oidasareta_node_Henkyou_de_Slow_Life_suru_Koto_ni_Shimashita"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":53488,"type":"anime","name":"Shin no Nakama ja Nai to Yuusha no Party wo Oidasareta node, Henkyou de Slow Life suru Koto ni Shimashita 2nd Season","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/53488/Shin_no_Nakama_ja_Nai_to_Yuusha_no_Party_wo_Oidasareta_node_Henkyou_de_Slow_Life_suru_Koto_ni_Shimashita_2nd_Season"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Iki wo Suu Koko de Suu Ikite (息を吸うここで吸う生きて)\" by Yui Nishio (ゆいにしお)"],"endings":["\"Minna Onaji (みんなおなじ)\" by JYOCHO"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-282769"}]}}
