Later, his mother gains a Stand, and becomes sick. Jotaro learns that it is because the vampire Dio Brando has been revived 100 years after his defeat to Jonathan Joestar, Jotaro's great-great-grandfather. Jotaro decides to join Joseph and Abdul in a trip to Egypt to defeat Dio once and for all.","background":"Shueisha and A.P.P.P. recalled shipments of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga and OVA's due to complaints by Egyptian Islamic fundamentalists, because a scene in the OVAs depicted Dio Brando reading the Qur'an.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1364,"type":"anime","name":"Super Techno Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1364/Super_Techno_Arts"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"APPP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/77/APPP"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":32,"type":"anime","name":"Vampire","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":872,"type":"manga","name":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/872/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_3__Stardust_Crusaders"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":665,"type":"anime","name":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/665/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken__Adventure"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":26055,"type":"anime","name":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders 2nd Season","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/26055/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_3__Stardust_Crusaders_2nd_Season"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
