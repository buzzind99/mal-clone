Gjallarhorn's political intervention into the Arbrau central parliament escalated into an armed conflict using mobile suits. The incident was brought to an end by Tekkadan, a group of boys who came from Mars.\n \nNews of Tekkadan's exploits has also reached the ears of Wistario Afam, a youth born and raised at the Radonitsa Colony near Venus. Venus, which lost to Mars in the contest for development, is a remote frontier planet in which the four great economic blocs show little interest. It is now used only as a penal colony for criminals, whose inhabitants don't even have IDs.\n \nThen Wistario, who hopes to change the status quo of this homeland, encounters a girl who claims to be the guide to the Urdr-Hunt.\n\n(Source: Gundam Global Portal)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2004,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise Beyond","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2004/Sunrise_Beyond"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":31251,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam: Tekketsu no Orphans","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31251/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Tekketsu_no_Orphans"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":33051,"type":"anime","name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam: Tekketsu no Orphans 2nd Season","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33051/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Tekketsu_no_Orphans_2nd_Season"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"The Over\" by Re:End"],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
