Memoru's people have such tiny bodies that they could stand on a human's palm. One day she hears lovely music, and she follows its source and comes upon a huge house she hasn't seen before to find a girl taller than her playing on the piano. Memoru visited her again secretly with her friends Popitu, Rupangu, and Pi, but the human girl, Marielle, seemed sick and likely to die any moment. Feeling sad for the girl, Memoru's tear drops on the girl's lips. The girl gets better and a strong friendship starts between them. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1984,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"08:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 08:30 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":12657,"type":"anime","name":"Tongari Boushi no Memole: Marielle no Housekibako","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12657/Tongari_Boushi_no_Memole__Marielle_no_Housekibako"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Tongari Boushi no Memoru (とんがり帽子のメモル)\" by Satoko Yamano"],"endings":["1: \"Yasashii Tomodachi (優しい友達)\" by Satoko Yamano","2: \"Tongari Boushi no Memoru: Marielle no Houseki Ban (とんがり帽子のメモル~マリエルの宝石版)\" by Satoko Yamano"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
