The theme of the contest was \"your original scenario in the image of Shounen Jump.\" The contest accepted unpublished entries that could be made into a short anime, 30 to 40 minutes in estimated length. Haneki's scenario won the Grand Prize, winning him 2 million yen, a manga adaptation on Shounen Jump+, and an anime adaptation. Akira Akatsuki, who was one of the judges in the competition, drew the manga. The anime premiered on the Shonen Jump+ website on October 14 at 12:00 a.m. (effectively October 15 at midnight). The anime also ran on the Hikari TV service on October 15 at 8:00 p.m. and on the Animax channel on October 22 at 8:00 p.m. A making-of video aired alongside the anime as a special.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":95521,"type":"manga","name":"Luger Code 1951","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/95521/Luger_Code_1951"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
