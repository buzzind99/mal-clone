As winners of the Kansai Regionals, Shitenhouji is one of the top contenders to win this year's tournament. What's more, each member of the Shitenhouji team has skills that are said to surpass their Seishun counterparts. Shitenhouji also has Kintarou Tooyama, another \"super rookie\" who rivals Ryouma in strength and technique. Seishun will have to push the limits of their abilities to stand a chance at defeating the Kansai champions in this East versus West matchup.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":463,"type":"anime","name":"M.S.C","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/463/MSC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":49,"type":"manga","name":"Tennis no Ouji-sama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/49/Tennis_no_Ouji-sama"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":995,"type":"anime","name":"Tennis no Ouji-sama: Zenkoku Taikai-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/995/Tennis_no_Ouji-sama__Zenkoku_Taikai-hen"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":4053,"type":"anime","name":"Tennis no Ouji-sama: Zenkoku Taikai-hen - Final","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4053/Tennis_no_Ouji-sama__Zenkoku_Taikai-hen_-_Final"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Kakaeta Kiseki\" by Aozu (eps 1-2)","2: \"Koi no Gekidasa Ecstasy\" by Tachikiri Tai (eps 3-6)"],"endings":["\"Thank you!!\" by Cap to Bin"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
