The first two episodes were brought out in English under the title of \"First Loves\" and bears no relationship to the \"Elf version Kakyuusei OAV\" and \"Kakyuusei TV series\" that were released in 1997-1998 and 1999 respectively. \n\nFirst Loves/Kakyuusei OAV (1995) is mainly centered on Kakeru and his relationship with four girls from his high school. It focuses on one girl per episode - the cute and friendly Urara in the first, the forsaken tennis girl Rie in the second, the dog-owning painter Hikari in the third and the tough-fighting motorcycle girl in the final episode. Which girl will Kakeru choose to be with by the end of the fourth episode? \n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":45,"type":"anime","name":"Pink Pineapple","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/45/Pink_Pineapple"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":813,"type":"anime","name":"SoftCel Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/813/SoftCel_Pictures"}],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Alternative setting","entry":[{"mal_id":510,"type":"anime","name":"Kakyuusei 2: Hitomi no Naka no Shoujo-tachi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/510/Kakyuusei_2__Hitomi_no_Naka_no_Shoujo-tachi"},{"mal_id":661,"type":"anime","name":"Elf-ban Kakyuusei: Anata dake wo Mitsumete...","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/661/Elf-ban_Kakyuusei__Anata_dake_wo_Mitsumete"},{"mal_id":2139,"type":"anime","name":"Kakyuusei 2: Anthology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2139/Kakyuusei_2__Anthology"},{"mal_id":2609,"type":"anime","name":"Kakyuusei (TV)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2609/Kakyuusei_TV"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Ano Koro...\" by Kaori Akima"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
