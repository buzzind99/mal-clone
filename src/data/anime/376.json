However, Nana's worries are directed more towards fellow resident Nyu, whom she had only known as Lucy, the violent Diclonius. Fearful that Nyu will unleash the same horrific savagery—violence that scars Nana to this day—upon those close to her, Nana faces a dilemma: attempt to live peacefully alongside Lucy with all the uncertainty that that entails or dispose of the source of her worries, shattering the relationships she has formed at the inn. As Nana struggles to come to a decision, Nyu recalls a painful memory of one of her dearest friends and one of her greatest rivals.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Taking place within the events of Episode 11 of the TV anime, the Elfen Lied Special combines an anime-exclusive story and a flashback arc from the 10th volume of the manga it is based on.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Arms","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/38/Arms"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":226,"type":"anime","name":"Elfen Lied","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/226/Elfen_Lied"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Lilium\" by Kumiko Noma"],"endings":["\"Be Your Girl\" by Chieko Kawabe"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https://www.hidive.com/movies/elfen-lied-ova"}]}}
