His reputation alone is enough to draw many curious players to his newly formed Guild Happy. Other competing guilds have enough to worry about with some of their own members abandoning them for Happy. However, they are also concerned by rumors that the person behind Lord Grim is really the retired professional gamer and \"Glory Textbook\" Ye Qiu, whom they have little chance of opposing. \n\nUnsure of the truth, the powerhouse guilds attempt to suppress Lord Grim's growing influence, harboring differing motives for doing so. But regardless of what obstacles he faces, Lord Grim is determined to break into the cross-server of Glory—the Heavenly Domain—where characters, including himself, can reach even greater levels. There, he hopes to round out the team of rookies who will fight alongside him in the Challenger League, which would be only their first step toward the coveted Glory Championship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1727,"type":"anime","name":"Tencent Penguin Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1727/Tencent_Penguin_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1728,"type":"anime","name":"China Literature Limited","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1728/China_Literature_Limited"},{"mal_id":1831,"type":"anime","name":"Colored Pencil Animation Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1831/Colored_Pencil_Animation_Japan"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2509,"type":"anime","name":"Colored Pencil Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2509/Colored_Pencil_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Video Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/79/Video_Game"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":33926,"type":"anime","name":"Quanzhi Gaoshou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33926/Quanzhi_Gaoshou"},{"mal_id":37078,"type":"anime","name":"Quanzhi Gaoshou Specials","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37078/Quanzhi_Gaoshou_Specials"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":49559,"type":"anime","name":"Quanzhi Gaoshou 3","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/49559/Quanzhi_Gaoshou_3"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Rongyao Poxiao\" by NZBZ"],"endings":["\"Our Glory Road\" by Mario"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
