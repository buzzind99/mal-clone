Based on a 1992 novel by Yoshio Aramaki, the series focuses on a technologically advanced Imperial Japanese Navy and a radically different Pacific War that was brought about by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's revival in the past due to unexplained circumstances. The series also features real-life 1940s figures whose first names were changed, such as Winston Churchill to Kingston Churchill and Adolf Hitler to Heinrich von Hitler.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":382,"type":"anime","name":"Tokuma Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/382/Tokuma_Shoten"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Alternative setting","entry":[{"mal_id":6230,"type":"anime","name":"Kyokujitsu no Kantai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6230/Kyokujitsu_no_Kantai"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":10335,"type":"anime","name":"Konpeki no Kantai: Sourai Kaihatsu Monogatari","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10335/Konpeki_no_Kantai__Sourai_Kaihatsu_Monogatari"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
