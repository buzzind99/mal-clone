After reading his story and seeing his awkward demeanor, she decides from that moment on to toy with him, even calling him \"Senpai\" in lieu of using his real name.\n\nAt first, Nagatoro's relentless antics are more bothersome than anything and leave him feeling embarrassed, as he is forced to cater to her whims. However, as they spend more time together, a strange sort of friendship develops between them, and Naoto finds that life with Nagatoro can even be fun. But one thing's for sure: his days will never be dull again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"01:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 01:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":73,"type":"anime","name":"TMS Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/73/TMS_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1344,"type":"anime","name":"King Records","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1344/King_Records"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":94,"type":"anime","name":"Telecom Animation Film","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/94/Telecom_Animation_Film"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":74,"type":"anime","name":"Romantic Subtext","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/74/Romantic_Subtext"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":110737,"type":"manga","name":"Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/110737/Ijiranaide_Nagatoro-san"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":50197,"type":"anime","name":"Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san 2nd Attack","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50197/Ijiranaide_Nagatoro-san_2nd_Attack"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"EASY LOVE\" by Sumire Uesaka (上坂 すみれ) (eps 2-12)"],"endings":["1: \"EASY LOVE\" by Sumire Uesaka (上坂 すみれ) (eps 1)","2: \"Colorful Canvas (カラフル・キャンバス)\" by Nagatoro-san (Sumire Uesaka), Gamo-chan (Mikako Komatsu), Yosshi (Aina Suzuki), Sakura (Shiori Izawa)  (eps 2-5, 7-12)","3: \"Colorful Canvas (カラフル・キャンバス)\" by Mayumi Kaneko (eps 6)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-281203"},{"name":"Anime Digital Network","url":"https://animedigitalnetwork.fr/"},{"name":"Bahamut Anime Crazy","url":"https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"},{"name":"iQIYI","url":"https://www.iq.com/"}]}}
