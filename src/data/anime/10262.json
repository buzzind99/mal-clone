In his infinite wisdom the young man decides that threatening a nearby elementary school kid is then best way to go! However, when that fails it seems that his only choice is to hold an autograph showdown between Saki and the psychotic idol wannabe, Bururu. Then, when a reckless teenager makes a bungled attempt to summon Satan, he and his friends must try and send the devil back to the underworld, but with their attempts just making him all the more infuriated will they emerge from the experience unscathed?\n\n(Source: Anime-Planet)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":315,"type":"anime","name":"DAX Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":1196,"type":"anime","name":"Masuda Kousuke Gekijou Gag Manga Biyori","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1196/Masuda_Kousuke_Gekijou_Gag_Manga_Biyori"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
