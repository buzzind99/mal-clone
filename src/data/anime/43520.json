Just after learning a fur, he couldn't help but want to go out to be a carpenter. Grandpa discouraged him, but he didn't pay attention. When the giraffe mother and the children were eating, they found that the dining table was broken. They were discussing to find grandpa panda to fix it. The little panda hummed a song and rushed to take over the job. As a result, the repair was repaired and the high table became a low table; Uncle Elephant’s bath tub had a loophole, and the little panda repaired it over and over to make a block of wood. What's more interesting is that when it helped the little monkeys repair the boxes with peaches, they put themselves in them. Little Panda is far from becoming a qualified carpenter.\n\n(Source: Douban)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":471,"type":"anime","name":"Shanghai Animation Film Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/471/Shanghai_Animation_Film_Studio"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
