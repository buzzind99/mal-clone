The apparent helpless nature of this force is hardly a deterrent for the encroaching enemy armies, ever closing in on both the 108th and the rest of the empire. The young pilots of the 108th, who had dreamed on returning home, are plunged forcefully and unwillingly into a war. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2005,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/112/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":30305,"type":"manga","name":"Gunparade Orchestra","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/30305/Gunparade_Orchestra"}]},{"relation":"Alternative setting","entry":[{"mal_id":266,"type":"anime","name":"Gunparade March: Arata Naru Kougunka","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/266/Gunparade_March__Arata_Naru_Kougunka"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":9445,"type":"anime","name":"Gunparade Orchestra OVA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9445/Gunparade_Orchestra_OVA"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Faze to love\" by Miyuki Hashimoto"],"endings":["\"Futari ga wasurenai\" by Aki Misato"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
