As Keith returns to the Royal Police to conduct his own investigation, Koku and Yuna try to enjoy an ordinary life in peace. But the consequences of the Jaula Blanca experiments are far from being extinct, as Koku soon discovers when his supposedly dead lab mate Kirisame suddenly shows up.\n\n(Source: Official Site)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1977,"type":"anime","name":"Netflix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1977/Netflix"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":32827,"type":"anime","name":"B: The Beginning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/32827/B__The_Beginning"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Be Down\" by ACCAMER"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
