The dark elves rule over a race of monsters that has raided human lands for generations, capturing and defiling their women. Aided by powerful bands of mercenaries, the human kingdoms have gradually pushed back their old rivals.\n\nBut the mercenaries would not settle for these victories. Led by the cruel general Volt, the sellswords declare independence. With the support of the savage orcs, their new nation attacks human and dark elf alike, carving out a kingdom where men reign supreme and women are little more than slaves. Even the dark elves' castle is conquered and their queen taken prisoner.\n\nThe sole hope for peace in these lands rests with a fellowship of seven princess knights, handpicked by the goddess of the high elves. But is their power enough to cleanse the evil from their world?","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":767,"type":"anime","name":"Majin","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/767/Majin"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":71769,"type":"manga","name":"Kuroinu: Kedakaki Seijo wa Hakudaku ni Somaru","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/71769/Kuroinu__Kedakaki_Seijo_wa_Hakudaku_ni_Somaru"},{"mal_id":109842,"type":"manga","name":"Kuroinu: Kedakaki Seijo wa Hakudaku ni Somaru: The Comic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/109842/Kuroinu__Kedakaki_Seijo_wa_Hakudaku_ni_Somaru__The_Comic"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":49095,"type":"anime","name":"Kuroinu II The Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/49095/Kuroinu_II_The_Animation"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Kuro Hana (黒華)\" by CycloMusic x Banana-Chan"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
