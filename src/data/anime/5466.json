It was never sold in stores and was a special omake by the series' creators to the fans. The OVA contains an epilogue to both series, which is fitting considering they both came out at the same time.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":595,"type":"anime","name":"NYAV Post","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/595/NYAV_Post"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":110,"type":"anime","name":"Triangle Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/110/Triangle_Staff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":629,"type":"anime","name":"Mahoutsukai Tai!","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/629/Mahoutsukai_Tai"},{"mal_id":1182,"type":"anime","name":"Shamanic Princess","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1182/Shamanic_Princess"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
