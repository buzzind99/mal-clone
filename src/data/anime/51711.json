After weathering through a bloody war, Ray enrolls at Arnold Academy, ready to experience a normal life—a luxury he never had. To further this goal, he keeps his identity as the Iceblade Magician a secret, the scars of the past still haunting him to this very day.\n\nDespite being ostracized for being a commoner, Ray befriends the prideful yet kind Amelia Rose, the muscle-brained Evy Armstrong, and the shy and bookish Elisa. However, conspiracy is lurking in the academy walls, and Ray is tasked with hunting down a spy whose motives remain unclear. To protect his newfound friends and the people he holds dear, Ray will do whatever it takes, even if it means confronting his past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"01:28","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 01:28 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"},{"mal_id":1542,"type":"anime","name":"DMM.com","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1542/DMMcom"},{"mal_id":1585,"type":"anime","name":"Nichion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1585/Nichion"},{"mal_id":1589,"type":"anime","name":"NichiNare","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1589/NichiNare"},{"mal_id":1687,"type":"anime","name":"Yokohama Animation Lab","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1687/Yokohama_Animation_Lab"},{"mal_id":2074,"type":"anime","name":"Bit grooove promotion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2600,"type":"anime","name":"Cloud Hearts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2600/Cloud_Hearts"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":135542,"type":"manga","name":"Hyouken no Majutsushi ga Sekai wo Suberu: Sekai Saikyou no Majutsushi de Aru Shounen wa, Majutsu Gakuin ni Nyuugaku suru","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/135542/Hyouken_no_Majutsushi_ga_Sekai_wo_Suberu__Sekai_Saikyou_no_Majutsushi_de_Aru_Shounen_wa_Majutsu_Gakuin_ni_Nyuugaku_suru"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Dystopia\" by Sizuk"],"endings":["\"Loud Hailer (ラウドヘイラ―)\" by Maaya Uchida (内田真礼)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-283367"},{"name":"Bilibili Global","url":"https://www.bilibili.tv/en/index"}]}}
