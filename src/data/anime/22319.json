Reserved college student Ken Kaneki buries his nose in books and avoids the news of the growing crisis. However, the appearance of an attractive woman named Rize Kamishiro shatters his solitude when she forwardly asks him on a date.\n\nWhile walking Rize home, Kaneki discovers she isn't as kind as she first appeared, and she has led him on with sinister intent. After a tragic struggle, he later awakens in a hospital to learn his life was saved by transplanting the now deceased Rize's organs into his own body.\n\nKaneki's body begins to change in horrifying ways, and he transforms into a human-ghoul hybrid. As he embarks on his new dreadful journey, Kaneki clings to his humanity in the evolving bloody conflict between society's new monsters and the government agents who hunt them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":751,"type":"anime","name":"Marvelous AQL","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/751/Marvelous_AQL"},{"mal_id":1283,"type":"anime","name":"TC Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1283/TC_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":33327,"type":"manga","name":"Tokyo Ghoul","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/33327/Tokyo_Ghoul"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":27899,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo Ghoul √A","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/27899/Tokyo_Ghoul_√A"}]},{"relation":"Spin-off","entry":[{"mal_id":30458,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo Ghoul: \"Jack\"","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/30458/Tokyo_Ghoul__Jack"},{"mal_id":31297,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo Ghoul: \"Pinto\"","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31297/Tokyo_Ghoul__Pinto"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"unravel\" by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure (eps 2-11)"],"endings":["1: \"unravel\" by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure (eps 1, 12)","2: \"Seijatachi (聖者たち)\" by People In The Box (eps 2-11)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-276013"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https://www.funimation.com/shows/tokyo-ghoul"},{"name":"Netflix","url":"https://www.netflix.com/"},{"name":"Shahid","url":"https://shahid.mbc.net/en/series/Tokyo-Ghoul/series-884468"}]}}
