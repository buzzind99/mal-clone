Will he admit his true feelings and save the Earth? Or will his pride doom it to destruction?\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":99,"type":"anime","name":"Kitty Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/99/Kitty_Films"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":310,"type":"anime","name":"AnimEigo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/310/AnimEigo"},{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":207,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Bus","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/207/Magic_Bus"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":304,"type":"manga","name":"Urusei Yatsura","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/304/Urusei_Yatsura"}]},{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":1293,"type":"anime","name":"Urusei Yatsura","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1293/Urusei_Yatsura"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Suki Kirai (Like It Or Not)\" by Asada Hanako"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-280947"}]}}
