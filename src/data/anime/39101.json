The tape contained 3 episodes covering the major plots of the previous 3 series in Japan (Tatakae! Chou Robot Seimeitai Transformers, Tatakae! Chou Robot Seimeitai Transformers 2010, and Transformers Headmasters). \n\nOnly the 3rd episode, Eiyuu Densetsu: Head On! Master Senshi is counted in this entry as it recaps Transformers Headmasters, an anime produced and animated in Japan. The first two episodes recap an American production of Transformers and thus do not count towards in this entry.\n\n(Source: tfraw and tfwiki)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Full story","entry":[{"mal_id":925,"type":"anime","name":"Transformers: The☆Headmasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/925/Transformers__The☆Headmasters"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
