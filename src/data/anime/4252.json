Ray's examining an exciting new archeological discovery: a legendary temple located in an isolated area of the world. \n\nAs always, she has with her a strange mirror that belonged to her father; a mirror that may provide access to a vanished civilization. On the excavation, Ray meets Mai and Mami Tachibana, freewheeling pubescent girls who heedlessly court danger. And danger they find, in the form of Rig Veda. \n\nVeda's after a big prize: Ray's mirror. But she will have to stop him at all costs, because if Veda gets his hands on the powerful object, he will possess secrets that could lead to disaster.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":224,"type":"anime","name":"Toshiba EMI","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/224/Toshiba_EMI"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"},{"mal_id":155,"type":"anime","name":"animate Film","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/155/animate_Film"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":29221,"type":"manga","name":"Explorer Woman Ray","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/29221/Explorer_Woman_Ray"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Lights of Love\" by Tamaki Satou (佐藤環)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
