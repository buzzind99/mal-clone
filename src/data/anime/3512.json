However, Midori's perfect plan for the debate falls apart when she trips on her way off the stage, exposing her underpants to the entire school.\n\nTo Midori's rescue comes rival candidate Akira Sudou—the boy that Midori has liked ever since witnessing the kind and caring nature he hides behind his intimidating looks. Shortly after, the two are elected to the council, where they must start preparing for the upcoming school festival. In their busy and lively days, Midori's love only deepens as she attempts to get closer to Akira, but pieces of his mysterious past hold him back from fully opening up to her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":86,"type":"anime","name":"Group TAC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/86/Group_TAC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1496,"type":"manga","name":"Tenshi Nanka ja Nai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/1496/Tenshi_Nanka_ja_Nai"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Issho ni Ireba (一緒にいれば)\" by Hikaru Nishida"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
