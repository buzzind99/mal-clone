However, with the outbreak of the Pacific War (World War II) in 1941, a great number of the \"Blue-eyed Dolls,\" who were considered to be \"dolls of the enemy country,\" were disposed of by being burned or by being stabbed with bamboo spears. \n\nThis is the story of children trying to rescue the doll.\n\n(Source: wgordon.web.wesleyan.edu)","background":"Although many of the dolls actually did not have blue eyes, they were fondly received by the Japanese children of the time, even giving rise to a popular song \"Blue-eyed Doll\". To express their gratitude for the gifts, the Japanese sent 58 Japanese dolls to America. During the war, the dolls sent to the U.S. were not destroyed, but were put away in storage where they could not be viewed. Currently, about 38 Japanese dolls and 300 blue-eyed dolls are known to still exist.
