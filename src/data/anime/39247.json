On one such day, however, a massive landslide is spotted on the hill where Kobayashi and Tooru first met—a clear display of a dragon's might. When none of the dragons they know claim responsibility, the perpetrator herself descends from the skies: Ilulu, the radical Chaos Dragon with monstrous power rivaling that of Tooru.\n\nSickened by Tooru's involvement with humans, Ilulu resorts to the typical dragon method of resolving conflict—a battle to the death. Despite such behavior, she becomes intrigued by Kobayashi's ability to befriend dragons and decides instead to observe just what makes Kobayashi so special. With a new troublesome dragon in town, Kobayashi's eccentric life with a dragon maid is only getting merrier.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":1500,"type":"anime","name":"ABC Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"},{"mal_id":2147,"type":"anime","name":"Heart Company","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2147/Heart_Company"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Kyoto Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2/Kyoto_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":80119,"type":"manga","name":"Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/80119/Kobayashi-san_Chi_no_Maid_Dragon"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":35363,"type":"anime","name":"Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon: Valentine, Soshite Onsen! - Amari Kitai Shinaide Kudasai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/35363/Kobayashi-san_Chi_no_Maid_Dragon__Valentine_Soshite_Onsen_-_Amari_Kitai_Shinaide_Kudasai"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":48590,"type":"anime","name":"Mini Dragon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/48590/Mini_Dragon"},{"mal_id":49483,"type":"anime","name":"Mini Dragon Specials","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/49483/Mini_Dragon_Specials"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":49893,"type":"anime","name":"Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon S: Nippon no Omotenashi - Attend wa Dragon desu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/49893/Kobayashi-san_Chi_no_Maid_Dragon_S__Nippon_no_Omotenashi_-_Attend_wa_Dragon_desu"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Ai no Supreme (愛のシュプリーム！)\" by fhána"],"endings":["\"Maid with Dragons❤︎ (めいど・うぃず・どらごんず︎❤︎)\" by Super Chorogonzu (スーパーちょろゴンず)","2: \"Ishukan❤︎Relationship (イシュカン❤︎リレーションシップ)\" by Tooru (トール) (CV: Yuuki Kuwahara (桑原由気)) (eps 3)","3: \"Aozora no Rhapsody (青空のラプソディ)\" by fhána (eps 12)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-272199"},{"name":"Aniplus TV","url":"http://www.aniplustv.com/"},{"name":"Bilibili","url":"https://www.bilibili.com/"},{"name":"Laftel","url":"https://laftel.net/"},{"name":"Wakanim","url":"https://www.wakanim.tv/"}]}}
