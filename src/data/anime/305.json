Led by the frightening Daemon Abashiri, the family prepares to perform their final, greatest heist. As the family makes their assault on a large bank, Daemon reveals that his youngest child, Kikunosuke Abashiri, is actually the first daughter born to the family in 18 generations—which is why he wants to end their life of crime.\n\nMuch to Kikunosuke's displeasure, her father has arranged for her to study at the elite Paradise Academy, hoping that the school will shape her into a proper lady. However, when she arrives, she finds that the place is even more brutal than the life of crime she just left! How does Kikunosuke intend to survive in a school full of teachers who are hell-bent on killing their students?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":921,"type":"anime","name":"Dynamic Planning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/921/Dynamic_Planning"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":7756,"type":"manga","name":"Abashiri Ikka","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/7756/Abashiri_Ikka"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":4923,"type":"anime","name":"Akai Hayate","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4923/Akai_Hayate"},{"mal_id":12769,"type":"anime","name":"Yumemakura Baku Twilight Gekijou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12769/Yumemakura_Baku_Twilight_Gekijou"},{"mal_id":20385,"type":"anime","name":"Eguchi Hisashi no Kotobuki Gorou Show","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/20385/Eguchi_Hisashi_no_Kotobuki_Gorou_Show"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["''Yasashiku Nankanai!'' by Tonguu Kyouko"],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
