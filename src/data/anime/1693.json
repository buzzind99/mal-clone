His daily routine is disrupted when his family gets news that his Father's remains have been discovered—a noted archeologist and researcher who had gone missing while exploring a site many years before. Among his remains were notes and artifacts that needed to be identified by the family near a notable triangular mountain in Japan known as \"Japan's pyramid\", a place suspected by some to be man-made. A meteor containing a strange robotic lifeform falls from the sky and begins to cause destruction, putting Saiga in danger and causing a mysterious bracelet from his father's research to activate and merge him with an ancient robot burried within the pyramid—a robot the runes describe as Reideen. It is now up to Saiga and guardian Reideen to fight against this unknown alien threat from the sky.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":577,"type":"anime","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":10355,"type":"manga","name":"Reideen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/10355/Reideen"}]},{"relation":"Spin-off","entry":[{"mal_id":2127,"type":"anime","name":"Chouja Raideen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2127/Chouja_Raideen"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":2128,"type":"anime","name":"Yuusha Raideen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2128/Yuusha_Raideen"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"manacles\" by Tomiko Van"],"endings":["\"Kakeashi no Ikizama\" by Ataru Nakamura"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https://www.hidive.com/tv/reideen"}]}}
