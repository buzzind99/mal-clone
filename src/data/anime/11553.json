Desperate to beat his bentos, Ryuuji obsessively tries to compete against them to the point where he even brings a rice cooker to school. After Taiga brings him some salty onigiri, Ryuuji realises that the true meaning of bentos is not the taste, but the feelings that are put into it.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":372,"type":"anime","name":"NIS America, Inc.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/372/NIS_America_Inc"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":47,"type":"anime","name":"Gourmet","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/47/Gourmet"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":4224,"type":"anime","name":"Toradora!","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Pre-Parade (プレパレード)\" by Rie Kugimiya, Yui Horie, and Eri Kitamura"],"endings":["\"Vanilla Salt (バニラソルト)\" by Yui Horie"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
