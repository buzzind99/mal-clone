Agencies have been set up to train mascots to babysit children and then to place the mascots within families. Noramimi is one such mascot at the Hello Kids branch office #59. Unfortunately, no family wants to adopt a mascot born from a demon (oni) family, so he is stuck living at the agency.\n\nSource: ANN, Moon Phase","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":2174,"type":"anime","name":"TMS Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2174/TMS_Music"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":73,"type":"anime","name":"TMS Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/73/TMS_Entertainment"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Childcare","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/53/Childcare"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1713,"type":"manga","name":"Noramimi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/1713/Noramimi"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":5089,"type":"anime","name":"Noramimi 2","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5089/Noramimi_2"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Furui Teikyuubi no Uta\" by Masaki Kurihara"],"endings":["\"roundabout\" by Seira Kagami"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
