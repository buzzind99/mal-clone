In an odd parallel Yat-chan follows a boy named Ken-chan who looks a lot like him, who acts a lot like him (irresponsibly near traffic) when he was alive, and who also has a childhood friend and classmate named Miko (unrelated to Yat-chan's Miko from the first OVA).\n\nKen-chan nearly perishes the same way Yat-chan thanks to Yat-chan using his beam to save his life. Ken-chan encounters a few other people who are ignoring traffic safety and with Yat-chan following, they help some people out. Such as an elderly woman who tries to cross a road because to tired to climb up the stairs of a pedestrian overpass.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":39454,"type":"anime","name":"Yat-chan to Kasei no Ko","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39454/Yat-chan_to_Kasei_no_Ko"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
