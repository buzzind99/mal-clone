She's got a Mad Scientist named Breckenridge living upstairs who is chronically late with the rent, and she's pining for Jim, a handsome watchmaker's apprentice whom she mistakenly believes is pursuing the local flower girl.\n\nBut this isn't our world. It is a world that has the Spirit of Wonder, where every so often, just occasionally mind you, amazing things happen. The Mad Scientist actually has come up with an incredible invention, and Jim has an unbelievable plan to use it to give Miss China the most beautiful ring in all the World.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":224,"type":"anime","name":"Toshiba EMI","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/224/Toshiba_EMI"},{"mal_id":2135,"type":"anime","name":"Imagine","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2135/Imagine"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":310,"type":"anime","name":"AnimEigo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/310/AnimEigo"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Ajia-Do","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/30/Ajia-Do"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":864,"type":"manga","name":"Spirit of Wonder","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/864/Spirit_of_Wonder"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":2420,"type":"anime","name":"Spirit of Wonder: Shounen Kagaku Club","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2420/Spirit_of_Wonder__Shounen_Kagaku_Club"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":6245,"type":"anime","name":"Spirit of Wonder: China-san Tanpenshuu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6245/Spirit_of_Wonder__China-san_Tanpenshuu"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Yume no Tobira (夢の扉)\" by Hidaka Noriko"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
