They failed then, but a Dr. Myunihausen (Munchausen?) tries again, through the manipulation of Nagumo's brother Takeaki. His goal? To have the Chojin replaced.\n\nAs Takeaki is injured in the approaching flight, Nagumo donates some of his blood to save his life, thus infusing Takeaki with the powers of the overfiend. And the results might be too much for Tokyo, perhaps even the overfiend himself, to bear.\n\n(Source: themanime.org)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":284,"type":"anime","name":"Central Park Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":329,"type":"anime","name":"Phoenix Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/329/Phoenix_Entertainment"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":11821,"type":"manga","name":"Urotsukidouji","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/11821/Urotsukidouji"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":2341,"type":"anime","name":"Choujin Densetsu Urotsukidouji","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2341/Choujin_Densetsu_Urotsukidouji"}]},{"relation":"Full story","entry":[{"mal_id":2342,"type":"anime","name":"Shin Choujin Densetsu Urotsukidouji Mataiden","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2342/Shin_Choujin_Densetsu_Urotsukidouji_Mataiden"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":2343,"type":"anime","name":"Choujin Densetsu Urotsukidouji: Mirai-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2343/Choujin_Densetsu_Urotsukidouji__Mirai-hen"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
