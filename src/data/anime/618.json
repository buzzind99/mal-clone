During his journey, he meets Shigure, a priestess who has never seen the world outside her village. But when a group of demons destroys the village and kills everyone, Jubei becomes a prime target after acquiring the Dragon Jewel—a stone with an unknown origin. Meanwhile, Shigure—along with the monk Dakuan and a young thief named Tsubute—travels to the village of Yagyu. And with two demon clans now hunting down Shigure, Dakuan must once again acquire the services of Jubei to protect the Priestess of Light.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2003,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":494,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Take Off","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/494/Studio_Take_Off"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"},{"mal_id":1447,"type":"anime","name":"Urban Vision","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1447/Urban_Vision"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"},{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":617,"type":"anime","name":"Juubee Ninpuuchou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/617/Juubee_Ninpuuchou"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":54017,"type":"anime","name":"Juubee Ninpuuchou Burst","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/54017/Juubee_Ninpuuchou_Burst"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Jubei's Theme\" by Kitaro"],"endings":["\"Shigure's Theme\" by Kitaro"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-280690"}]}}
