Tsuyoshi was very ambitious and hoped to enter a prestigious private school, so his days were filled with study. Whenever asked by anyone for a favor, Tsuyoshi resented having to give up his free time.\n\nIn the early morning hours of January 17, 1995, a massive earthquake rocked Kobe City. Tsuyoshi and his family managed to escape from their shattered home and evacuated to his school. The problems of communal living and rationing, as well as the selfless example of the many volunteers, are lessons the children are soon to learn.\n\n(Source: Eleven Arts)","background":"Chikyuu ga Ugoita Hi is based on Etsuko Kishikawa's 1996 children's novel of the same name, which is set during the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake in Kobe.
