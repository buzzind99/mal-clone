Nevertheless, it is the home of sisters Iina, Aruto, and Kokoro, who consider it their mission to keep the library running in their parents' stead. Kokoro has long dreamed of becoming a librarian at the library with the same name as her, and tries her best to keep up with her older sisters.\n\nDue to the lack of patrons, the girls mainly spend their time sipping tea, chatting, and reading. However, as the number of mysterious visitors progressively increases, Kokoro begins to learn about the strange history of Kokoro Library—a place where small miracles seem to blossom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2001,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"01:15","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 01:15 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":123,"type":"anime","name":"Victor Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/123/Victor_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"},{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"Workplace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":2702,"type":"manga","name":"Kokoro Toshokan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/2702/Kokoro_Toshokan"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":5472,"type":"anime","name":"Kokoro Toshokan: Communication Clips","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5472/Kokoro_Toshokan__Communication_Clips"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Beagle\" by Yasuko Yamano"],"endings":["\"Tsuki wa Miteru\" by Yasuko Yamano"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
