But they were very wrong when they thought that Anmitsu will finally start studying seriously, because she will frequently escape from the castle looking for some fun, and in the process she will learn a lot about the outside world, make numerous friends and cause endless trouble for the inhabitants of the castle who are supposed to take care of her.","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1986,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":769,"type":"anime","name":"Fujipacific Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/769/Fujipacific_Music"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":["\"Koi wa Question (恋はくえすちょん)\" by Onyanko Club"],"endings":["\"Anmitsu Daisakusen (あんみつ大作戦)\" by Onyanko Club"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
