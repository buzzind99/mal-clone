Each episode is told like the chapter of a storybook, where Randy learns a valuable thing in life with his cartoonish and goofy friend Chacha. Randy meets several friends in his neighbourhood, such as Catherine, the tall blonde girl in red long socks who rides a bicycle, or Mary, a little hot-tempered brunette girl dressed as a maid and who carries around a mop.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2001,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":408,"type":"anime","name":"Amino","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/408/Amino"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Daume","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/39/Daume"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":71,"type":"anime","name":"Pets","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/71/Pets"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":4054,"type":"anime","name":"Norimono Oukoku BuBu ChaCha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4054/Norimono_Oukoku_BuBu_ChaCha"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Kimi no BuBu ChaCha (君のぶぶチャチャ)\" by Minako Kaneko (金子美奈子) (eps 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24)","2: \"Kimi no BuBu ChaCha (君のぶぶチャチャ)\" by Mariko Takase and Pythagoras (高瀬麻里子&ピタゴラス) (eps 5,13,23,26)","3: \"Kimi no BuBu ChaCha (君のぶぶチャチャ)\" by Pythagoras (ピタゴラス) (eps 7)","4: \"Kimi no BuBu ChaCha (君のぶぶチャチャ)\" by Mariko Takase (高瀬麻里子) (eps 9)","5: \"Kimi no BuBu ChaCha (君のぶぶチャチャ)\" by Boku, ChaCha (eps 11)","6: \"Kimi no BuBu ChaCha (君のぶぶチャチャ)\" by Boku, ChaCha, Mama, Papa, Catherine, Mary, Nick and Terry (eps 15,19)","7: \"Kimi no BuBu ChaCha (君のぶぶチャチャ)\" by Mary and Pythagoras (eps 17,25)"],"endings":["1: \"Minna Watarou (みんなわたろう)\" by Minako Kaneko (金子美奈子) (eps 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,22,24)","2: \"Minna Watarou (みんなわたろう)\" by Mariko Takase (高瀬麻里子) (eps 5,17)","3: \"Minna Watarou (みんなわたろう)\" by Mariko Takase and Pythagoras (高瀬麻里子&ピタゴラス) (eps 7,13,26)","4: \"Minna Watarou (みんなわたろう)\" by Pythagoras (ピタゴラス) (eps 9,25)","5: \"Minna Watarou (みんなわたろう)\" by Nick and Terry with ChaCha (eps 11,19)","6: \"Minna Watarou (みんなわたろう)\" by Boku, Mama, Papa, Catherine, Mary, Nick and Terry (eps 15,20,23)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
