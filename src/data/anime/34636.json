He has gotten through life by avoiding any kind of confrontation and blending in with the crowd. But blending in isn't enough to get out of trouble, as some bullies harass him for money. Luckily, he is saved by a man named Kaname Sengoku.\n\nKaname invites Tatara to his dance studio. Although he would normally never set foot in such a place, Tatara is captivated by Sengoku's commanding presence. Granted an opportunity to dance with fellow classmate Shizuku Hanaoka—who often practices at the studio—Tatara realizes there's something about the idea of being put in the limelight and dancing where people will see him that keeps him coming back. With an earnest, passionate drive to improve, Tatara begins his journey into the world of competitive dance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"02:08","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 02:08 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":1097,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Games","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1097/Bandai_Namco_Games"},{"mal_id":1390,"type":"anime","name":"Toy's Factory","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1390/Toys_Factory"},{"mal_id":1449,"type":"anime","name":"Animatic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1449/Animatic"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1201,"type":"anime","name":"Ponycan USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1201/Ponycan_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":70,"type":"anime","name":"Performing Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/70/Performing_Arts"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":48347,"type":"manga","name":"Ballroom e Youkoso","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/48347/Ballroom_e_Youkoso"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"10% roll, 10% romance\" by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN (eps 1-11)","2: \"Invisible Sensation\" by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN (eps 12-24)"],"endings":["1: \"Maybe the next waltz\" by Mikako Komatsu (eps 1-11)","2: \"Swing heart direction\" by Mikako Komatsu (eps 12-24)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-281520"}]}}
