But when their latest assailants turn out to be humans, the group is left dumbfounded. The mystery only deepens when they encounter a wandering priest, Hazel Grouse, and his imposing bodyguard, Gaty Nene Hawk. The pair hails from the far West, with Hazel using his powers of resurrection to aid grief-stricken villages. While his ability is greatly welcomed by the people, the truth behind it is less miraculous than it seems. Furthermore, the resurrected humans gain golden eyes, a trait they share with the group's recent attackers. It appears that the friendly priest's intentions are not as generous as one might expect—and the Sanzou party is a step away from unraveling them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Saiyuuki Reload: Zeroin is a remake of the 2nd half of Saiyuuki Reload Gunlock, and adapts Saiyuuki Reload manga's Even a Worm arc.","season":"winter","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":839,"type":"anime","name":"LIDENFILMS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":43,"type":"anime","name":"Josei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":510,"type":"manga","name":"Saiyuuki Reload","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/510/Saiyuuki_Reload"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":130,"type":"anime","name":"Saiyuuki Reload","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/130/Saiyuuki_Reload"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":131,"type":"anime","name":"Saiyuuki Reload Gunlock","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/131/Saiyuuki_Reload_Gunlock"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":33726,"type":"anime","name":"Saiyuuki Reload Blast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33726/Saiyuuki_Reload_Blast"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Kami mo Hotoke mo (カミモホトケモ)\" by GRANRODEO"],"endings":["\"Ruten (流転)\" by Shuugo Nakamura"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https://www.hidive.com/tv/saiyuki-reload-zeroin"},{"name":"Anime Digital Network","url":"https://animedigitalnetwork.fr/"},{"name":"Aniverse","url":"https://www.amazon.de/b/?_encoding=UTF8&benefitId=aniversede&node=3010075031"},{"name":"Bahamut Anime Crazy","url":"https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"},{"name":"Bilibili","url":"https://www.bilibili.com/"},{"name":"CatchPlay","url":"https://www.catchplay.com/"},{"name":"Genflix","url":"https://genflix.co.id/"},{"name":"MeWatch","url":"https://www.mewatch.sg/"},{"name":"Muse Asia","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGbshtvS9t-8CW11W7TooQg"},{"name":"Sushiroll","url":"https://sushiroll.co.id/"},{"name":"TrueID","url":"https://home.trueid.net/"}]}}
