Naccio and Pomm bounce and bumble through their explorations of everyday settings -- everyday to us Earthlings, that is. For the two aliens, every experience is new and endlessly enjoyable.\n\n(Source: microjapan.com)","background":"　","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":111,"type":"anime","name":"NHK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
