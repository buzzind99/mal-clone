Unable to avert their gaze, the air is full of awe and wonder—but those who know the Mushi are preparing for the eclipse's aftermath.\n\nBased on a prediction from Tanyuu Karibusa, the cursed recorder, Mushishi Ginko finds himself in a very unlucky farming village. Immediately following the solar eclipse, a strange black cloud begins to gather in the sky and blocks the sun once more. Suspecting it to be the work of a Mushi known as Hihami, Ginko seeks to liberate the village from perpetual darkness. However, it seems that not all of the villagers are eager to return to the light.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":711,"type":"anime","name":"Delfi Sound","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/711/Delfi_Sound"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Artland","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/8/Artland"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":62023,"type":"manga","name":"Mushishi Tokubetsu-hen: Hihamukage","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/62023/Mushishi_Tokubetsu-hen__Hihamukage"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":457,"type":"anime","name":"Mushishi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/457/Mushishi"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":21939,"type":"anime","name":"Mushishi Zoku Shou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/21939/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Hihamukage (日蝕む翳)\" by Toshio Masuda"],"endings":["\"Hinata (日向)\" by Toshio Masuda"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-258413"}]}}
