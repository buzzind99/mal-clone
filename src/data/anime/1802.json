Afterwards, the two continued to work together, although they earned their nickname, \"the Dirty Pair\" because of all the collateral damage the two (unintentionally) cause in the completion of their cases. And even though the two now get along with one another, they continue to bicker and complain to each other.\n\nAlthough it is often said that these are younger versions of the original Lovely Angels Kei and Yuri, in truth this series is an alternate universe telling of Dirty Pair, set in the years 2248-49.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"},{"mal_id":829,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Jack","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/829/Studio_Jack"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":20300,"type":"manga","name":"Dirty Pair Flash","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/20300/Dirty_Pair_Flash"}]},{"relation":"Alternative setting","entry":[{"mal_id":424,"type":"anime","name":"Dirty Pair","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/424/Dirty_Pair"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":12343,"type":"anime","name":"Dirty Pair Flash 2","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12343/Dirty_Pair_Flash_2"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Kagirinai Answer (限りないANSWER)\" by Mana (eps 1-6)","2: \"Thrill ni Aishite (スリルに恋して)\" by Matsumoto Rika (eps 7-11)","3: \"Honki ni Shinaide (本気にしないで)\" by Kouda Mariko (eps 12-16)"],"endings":["1: \"Dai 2 Shou (第2章)\" by Mana (eps 1-6)","2: \"Kimi ga Daisuki (キミがダイスキ♡)\" by Kouda Mariko (eps 7-11)","3: \"Kokoro de Mitsumeteru (心で見つめてる)\" by Matsumoto Rika (eps 12-16)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
