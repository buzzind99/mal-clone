Her crew, also one of the newest, is lead by Capt. Umezu Saburo and Executive Officer Kadomatsu Yosuke. While running scheduled training exercises one day, Mirai encounters a fierce storm that throws their navigation systems into temporary disarray. After a few minutes of recovery, the crew is shocked to discover that they've been transported back in time to June 4, 1942—The Battle of Midway, during World War II. Letting history take its course for this battle, they manage to avoid the conflict firsthand and make a vow to remain anonymous, changing history as little as possible. However, when the crew comes across the dying Lt. Commander Kusaka Takumi, XO. Kadomatsu's instincts to save lives takes over, changing the course of history more than he could've imagined.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2004,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":82,"type":"anime","name":"Marvelous","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/82/Marvelous"},{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":78,"type":"anime","name":"Time Travel","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/78/Time_Travel"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":191,"type":"manga","name":"Zipang","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/191/Zipang"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Rashinban (羅針盤)\" by AUDIO RULEZ"],"endings":["\"Kimi wo Miteiru (君を見ている)\" by BEGIN"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
