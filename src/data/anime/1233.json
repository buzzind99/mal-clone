Moderated by hard-headed veteran ace Mitsuru Konishi, the \"Airbats\" are an all-female aerial acrobatic team consisting of loose cannons Miyuki Haneda and Arisa Mitaka, karaoke freak and gambling genius Sakura Saginomiya, and junk food lover Yoko Shimorenjaku. Both Haneda and Mitaka do not get along with each other, and their rivalry worsens when they both fall for Isurugi. But with the entire JASDF having doubts about the team, the Airbats must work as a team or face total disbandment.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Fantasia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/24/Studio_Fantasia"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":20392,"type":"manga","name":"Aozora Shoujotai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/20392/Aozora_Shoujotai"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Niji ni Naritai (I Wanna Be a Rainbow)\" by Mayaka"],"endings":["1: \"Taiyou ga Atatameta Kimochi (The Sun Warms My Heart)\" by Aya Hisakawa and Ai Orikasa (eps 1-3)","2: \"Fuchu Shigure (A Light Rain in Fuchu)\" by Kikuko Inoue (eps 4)","3: \"Love Letter in the Blue Sky\" by Yukana Nogami (eps 5-7)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
