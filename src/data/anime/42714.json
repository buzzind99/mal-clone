At a group date, she meets Shuuji Mashima—a professional consultant who seems to express a strong disinterest in women. But when Mio calls him out on his arrogance, Shuuji invites her to a hotel room to prove her initial impression wrong.\n\nDespite it being their first sexual encounter in years, the two discover satisfaction and pleasure they never experienced before. Chasing that incomparable sensation, Mio and Shuuji work together to help each other find the once lost feeling of yearning. However, they may soon realize that their deepest desire is, in fact, the person standing in front of them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":1760,"type":"anime","name":"Suiseisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1760/Suiseisha"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2114,"type":"anime","name":"Ether Kitten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2114/Ether_Kitten"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":124060,"type":"manga","name":"Otona nya Koi no Shikata ga Wakaranee!","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/124060/Otona_nya_Koi_no_Shikata_ga_Wakaranee"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Yoru ni Kekkai (夜に決壊)\" by Shuuji Mashima (Chasuke)","\"Yoru ni Kekkai (夜に決壊)\" by Shuuji Mashima (Kento Itou)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
