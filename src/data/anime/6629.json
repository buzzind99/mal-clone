One day, while bargain shopping, she wins the lucky ticket at a lottery for a one-person trip to Hawaii. Chaos reigns as her family, the Beach's, fight over who should go. The ticket is lost in a bonfire, ironically. Other circumstances follow when the family finds out that the travel agency offered to \"give the equal amount of half the travel expenses in cash for the ticket\" from an employee of the supermarket Asahi had shopped at. What will happen to the unlucky Beach family as more elements of despair pelt them?","background":null,"season":"winter","year":1982,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"TV Asahi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":16453,"type":"manga","name":"Asari-chan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/16453/Asari-chan"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":6630,"type":"anime","name":"Asari-chan: Ai no Marchen Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6630/Asari-chan__Ai_no_Marchen_Shoujo"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Ano Ko wa Asari-chan (あの子はあさりちゃん)\" by Youko Maekawa, Koorogi '73"],"endings":["\"Watashi wa Onna no Ko (私は女の子)\" by Youko Maekawa, Koorogi '73"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
