These four OVAs were uniquely designed and scripted, and the art style had been changed slightly from the original series as well. Each of these OVAs feature one of the Ai Tenshi along with a season: Wedding Peach—Summer, Angel Salvia—Autumn, Angel Daisy—Winter, Angel Lily—Spring. They are, however, in no way related to each other, except for some indication of previous OVAs by Hinagiku and Yuri. These are the adventures of the four Ai Tenshi, two years after their battle with Reine Devila.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"KSS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/50/KSS"},{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1228,"type":"manga","name":"Wedding Peach","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/1228/Wedding_Peach"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1533,"type":"anime","name":"Ai Tenshi Densetsu Wedding Peach","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1533/Ai_Tenshi_Densetsu_Wedding_Peach"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Merry Angel\" by FURIL'"],"endings":["\"Sweet Little Love\" by FURIL'"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
