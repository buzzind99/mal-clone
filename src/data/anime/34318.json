This couldn't be any worse, as the object of her affection is her oblivious classmate Haruka Kokonose. With their dispositions, Takane will never confess and Haruka will never notice. Maybe, however, she will finally be able to muster the courage to convey her feelings for him before the sun sets.\n\nOuter Science\nWithin the Heat Haze Daze, Kuroha rests beside his imprisoned former master, awaiting the next masterâ€”Mari Kozakura. No matter how she tries to rewrite the future, Mari is inevitably faced with tragedy, desperate to save those who matter most to her. But despair is never-ending, and what awaits her is an endless cycle of anguish. Not that it matters, as Kuroha will always be waiting.\n\nSummer Time Record\nAs the story of the Mekakushi-dan draws to a close, its members reminisce of times gone by. These children, who may have never met otherwise, are connected by the past. However, as they finally approach the end, they resolve to remember, hoping to one day meet again.\n\nShounen Brave\nKousuke Seto lacks courage more than anything else. Relentlessly bullied, his only friend is a dog, with whom he shares a bond that needs no words. However, this solace is destroyed by a tragedy, which burdens Seto with the red-eye power to hear others' thoughts. Haunted by the hurtful things he hears, he runs off, leading him to a fateful encounter. If it is for the sake of this person, Seto may finally have what it takes to be a little brave.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":21603,"type":"anime","name":"Mekakucity Actors","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/21603/Mekakucity_Actors"},{"mal_id":33219,"type":"anime","name":"Kagerou Daze: In a Day's","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33219/Kagerou_Daze__In_a_Days"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":36494,"type":"anime","name":"Mekakucity Records","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36494/Mekakucity_Records"},{"mal_id":37507,"type":"anime","name":"Red","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37507/Red"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
