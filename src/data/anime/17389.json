Their next target is Wei, a smaller state which stands as a geographic stepping stone for the sake of conquest.\n\nXin, now a three hundred man commander of the swiftly rising Fei Xin Unit, continues to seek out lofty achievements in order to garner recognition for himself and his soldiers, motivated by those previously lost in battle. In the preliminary battles ahead of Qin's invasion of Wei, Xin finds competition in other young commanders who are of a higher social status than him. Back in Qin, the royal palace faces turmoil as opposing factions begin to make their move against Ying Zheng's regime.\n\nWith their hands full both abroad and at home, Zheng and Xin must lead the way in this era of unending war, resolved to etch their names in history by creating a unified China.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2013,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"23:45","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 23:45 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":111,"type":"anime","name":"NHK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"},{"mal_id":1797,"type":"anime","name":"NHK Enterprises","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1797/NHK_Enterprises"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":16765,"type":"manga","name":"Kingdom","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/16765/Kingdom"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":12031,"type":"anime","name":"Kingdom","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12031/Kingdom"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":40682,"type":"anime","name":"Kingdom 3rd Season","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/40682/Kingdom_3rd_Season"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"GLORY DAYS\" by D☆DATE"],"endings":["1: \"21\" by The Sketchbook (eps 1-13)","2: \"Exit\" by The Sketchbook (eps 14-26)","3: \"Soko ni Kimi ga Iru\" by The Sketchbook (eps 27-39)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-274043"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https://www.funimation.com/shows/kingdom"},{"name":"Shahid","url":"https://shahid.mbc.net/en/series/Kingdom/series-868926"}]}}
