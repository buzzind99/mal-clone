Yui is a computer-illiterate girl who after a computer-lab accident is approached by IR, a raccoon looking corrector computer program, which tells her she must save COMNET. She must stop the rogue A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) computer program known as Grosser and his hench-programs from taking over the world. Grosser was originally designed to be that manager of all of COMNET. At first she's very reluctant to play the heroine because of her complete lack of knowledge and ability with computers. To save COMNET she must find and gain the trust of the other seven wayward corrector programs. They must also find the creator or COMNET Professor Inukai, to help stop Grosser for good.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":111,"type":"anime","name":"NHK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"},{"mal_id":216,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Tron","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/216/Studio_Tron"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/22/Nippon_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":172,"type":"manga","name":"Corrector Yui","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/172/Corrector_Yui"},{"mal_id":18411,"type":"manga","name":"Corrector Yui","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/18411/Corrector_Yui"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Eien to Iu Basho (永遠という場所)\" by Kyouko with Masayoshi Yamazaki & Sugashiko (eps 01-26)","2: \"Tori ni naru Toki (鳥になる時)\" by Satsuki (eps 27-52)"],"endings":["1: \"Mirai (未来; Future)\" by LEGOLGEL","2: \"Requiem (レクイエム)\" by Satsuki (eps 27-52)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
