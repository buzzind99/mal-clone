Empty beer tins, empty wine bottles, a half-empty glass of whisky...\n\nA girl is getting up absent-mindedly and starts preparing herself. YOUR morning starts. Lazy and hard-to-wake-up YOU. The emoticon is ME watching over YOU. I play tricks on YOU, while YOU are playing the guitar and drinking. One day, in town, YOU walk past THE CHILDHOOD FRIEND who is buying an Anemone I liked, and remembering that I liked them, YOU rush out to buy them. THE CHILDHOOD FRIEND displays the Anemone with care.\n\nOne day, years after I died, YOU hear noise from the closet. Opened, YOU see MY garden right in front of YOU. Overflowing emotions of ME and YOU. When exiting from the room with memories, a picture of the Anemone that YOU painted is displayed in YOUR new room. \n\n(Souce: Annecy Film Festival)","background":"The film internationally debuted at Scotland Loves Anime 2022.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1591,"type":"anime","name":"Science SARU","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1591/Science_SARU"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
