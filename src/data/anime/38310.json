The song itself parodies the songs Der Flohwalzer (in Japan named as Neko Fun Jatta / I Stepped on a Cat) and Beautiful Dreamer (Yumemiru Hito) depending on whether or not \"Yume\" is being seen as a real cat or as a metaphorical dream or as a dream Yume the cat is having.\n\nThe music video was aired for 1 month before becoming lost media.
