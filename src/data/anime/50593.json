If you find it, walk through and you'll find your heart's desire on the other side...in exchange for years of your own life. One night, Kaoru just so happens to find himself standing in front of a tunnel that looks suspiciously like the one the rumor describes. He finds himself thinking of Karen, the sister he lost in an accident five years ago.\n\nTo Kaoru's surprise, he's been followed by the new transfer student Anzu Hanashiro, who promises to help him experiment with the mysterious tunnel—but what does she want from Kaoru in exchange? And what will he have left to give, after the tunnel's done with him?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment, edited)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1876,"type":"anime","name":"CLAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1876/CLAP"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":138406,"type":"manga","name":"Natsu e no Tunnel, Sayonara no Deguchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/138406/Natsu_e_no_Tunnel_Sayonara_no_Deguchi"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
