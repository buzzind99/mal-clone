Nonetheless, Natsume never fails to show the same kindness to the benevolent youkai and happily returns their names by using the infamous Book of Friends he inherited from his late grandmother, Reiko.\n\nMeanwhile, the exorcist clan Matoba still wishes for Natsume to join their ranks due to his overwhelming gift. However, Natsume firmly rejects the clan's invitation since not all exorcists are as reasonable as his friend Shuuichi Natori, and many improperly and indiscriminately seal away every youkai in their way. Unsatisfied with Natsume's answer, Seiji Matoba blackmails Natsume into attending a grand gathering of powerful exorcist families. Natsume soon finds himself in the company of dangerous people and youkai alike. But even then, he continues to defy the exorcists' hard-handed methods and believes that peace between both worlds is possible.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Natsume Yuujinchou Go was released on Blu-ray and DVD in five volumes from December 21, 2016 to April 26, 2017.","season":"fall","year":2016,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"01:35","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 01:35 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":148,"type":"anime","name":"Hakusensha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/148/Hakusensha"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1119,"type":"anime","name":"Shuka","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1119/Shuka"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1859,"type":"manga","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/1859/Natsume_Yuujinchou"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":11665,"type":"anime","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou Shi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/11665/Natsume_Yuujinchou_Shi"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":34534,"type":"anime","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou Go Specials","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34534/Natsume_Yuujinchou_Go_Specials"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":34591,"type":"anime","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou Roku","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34591/Natsume_Yuujinchou_Roku"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Takarabako (タカラバコ)\" by Sasanomaly (ササノマリイ)"],"endings":["\"Akane Sasu (茜さす)\" by Aimer"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-271453"}]}}
