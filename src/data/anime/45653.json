His sole motive is falling in love at first sight with Urushi Yaotome—the club's president and only member—and will do anything to get closer to her. However, Ayumu decides not to confess to Urushi until he can beat her in a match of shogi fair and square.\n\nNaturally, this self-imposed hurdle is a formidable challenge for Ayumu to overcome, as Urushi is far more experienced at the game and sees through his every strategy. Nevertheless, this does not stop him from praising her looks, her skill, or even her smile, which, coupled with Ayumu's expressionless face and direct approach, makes Urushi constantly blush beet red. Learning more about shogi and the charming player sitting across from him, Ayumu inches toward making his confession with each exciting round they play together—even if it is one pawn at a time!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru was released on Blu-ray in two volumes from October 19, 2022 to December 21, 2022.","season":"summer","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"01:28","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 01:28 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":2542,"type":"anime","name":"Days","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2542/Days"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":300,"type":"anime","name":"SILVER LINK.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":74,"type":"anime","name":"Romantic Subtext","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/74/Romantic_Subtext"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":119216,"type":"manga","name":"Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/119216/Soredemo_Ayumu_wa_Yosetekuru"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Kakehiki wa Poker Face (駆け引きはポーカーフェイス)\" by Kana Hanazawa"],"endings":["\"50 cm (50センチ)\" by Urushi Yaotome (Kanna Nakamura)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https://www.hidive.com/"},{"name":"Anime Digital Network","url":"https://animedigitalnetwork.fr/"},{"name":"Aniplus TV","url":"http://www.aniplustv.com/"},{"name":"Bilibili Global","url":"https://www.bilibili.tv/en/index"}]}}
