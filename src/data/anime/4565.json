However, the boon of this lifestyle leaves them unprepared when an unknown, hostile threat arises due to the ever-growing human population. This calamity is the Anti-Spiral—a fearsome enemy with unparalleled power. \n \nAs the Spiral King's prognosis postulating the destruction of \"The Spiral's World\" begins to come true, the pieces are in place, and Team Dai-Gurren is ready. With his late brother's hope to see a better future for mankind, Simon—along with Nia Teppelin and the rest of the team—is determined to overthrow the mighty Anti-Spiral in order to revive humanity's lost hope.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Gainax","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/6/Gainax"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":2001,"type":"anime","name":"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":4107,"type":"anime","name":"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Movie 1: Gurren-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4107/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann_Movie_1__Gurren-hen"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Namida no Tane, Egao no Hana (涙の種、笑顔の花)\" by Shoko Nakagawa"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
