What he finds instead is a rare white-haired slave elf named Nephilia, and he immediately spends all his money to purchase her, much to the bewilderment of those around him. However, the secret reason behind Zagan's investment was that he had actually fallen in love with her at first sight.\n\nUnfortunately, Zagan has a problem: he is socially inept and has no idea how to express his true feelings, leading to many misunderstandings between him and his new companion. But slowly, the two begin to understand each other, and love begins to bloom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":103707,"type":"manga","name":"Maou no Ore ga Dorei Elf wo Yome ni Shitanda ga, Dou Medereba Ii?","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/103707/Maou_no_Ore_ga_Dorei_Elf_wo_Yome_ni_Shitanda_ga_Dou_Medereba_Ii"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
