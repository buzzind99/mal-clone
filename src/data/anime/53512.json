Her eyes are too small and her limbs are far from slender. She is, in fact, \"ugly,\" and as such, knows that cute things and a fairy-tale romance are out of her reach. Yet this does not stop her from daydreaming every morning as she tends to the school's beautiful flower beds that contrast her appearance.\n\nOne day, a casual encounter puts Tabata in contact with her classmate, Yousuke Ueno, who is well known for being both handsome and extremely kind. Why would such a popular student associate with a background character like her? To Tabata, it is an unfathomable situation, but can Ueno show her that looks aren't everything?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":108492,"type":"manga","name":"Busu ni Hanataba wo.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/108492/Busu_ni_Hanataba_wo"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
