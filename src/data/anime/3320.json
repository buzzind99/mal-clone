Meanwhile, a contest for the new \"Disco Queen\" is coming up, and Miho wants nothing more than to be able to design a dress for someone to wear to the competition, since she's too young to enter herself. With determination and a little bit of magic, Miho's dreams just might come true!","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Spin-off","entry":[{"mal_id":604,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou no Stage Fancy Lala","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/604/Mahou_no_Stage_Fancy_Lala"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Destiny Light\" by Naomi Masuda"],"endings":["\"Twilight Dream\" by Manami Komori"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
