The evil queen Raindevilla yearns to destroy the angel world with help or her many devil minions. The goddess Aphrodite sends an angel to the human world, Limone, to summon three love angels in the form of three school girls, Momoko Hanasaki, Yuri Tanima, and Hinagiku Tamano, who together become Angel Lilly, Angel Daisy, and Wedding Peach. The three girls must fight to overcome the evils of the devils, as well as their own lives, and restore peace to the angel world by gathering all pieces of the Sacred Four Somethings (or Saint Something Four) and defeat the evil queen once and for all.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1995,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"KSS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/50/KSS"},{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":829,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Jack","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/829/Studio_Jack"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1228,"type":"manga","name":"Wedding Peach","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/1228/Wedding_Peach"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1957,"type":"anime","name":"Ai Tenshi Densetsu Wedding Peach DX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1957/Ai_Tenshi_Densetsu_Wedding_Peach_DX"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":26189,"type":"anime","name":"Ai Tenshi Densetsu Wedding Peach Specials","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/26189/Ai_Tenshi_Densetsu_Wedding_Peach_Specials"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Yumemiru Ai Tenshi (夢見る愛天使)\" by Furil (eps 1-27)","2: \"Wedding Wars ~Ai wa Honou~ (Wedding Wars〜愛は炎〜)\" by Erina Nakajima (eps 28-51)"],"endings":["1: \"Juliet Of The 21st Century\" by Furil","2: \"Virgin Love\" by Furil"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
