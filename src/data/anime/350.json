Her parents are always fighting, her little sister makes fun of her, and her crush pines after another girl. If only Doremi could just wave a magic wand, she would have a much better life—or so she used to think.\n\nAfter a mishap with a real witch, Doremi becomes an apprentice witch herself, and it turns out she's pretty horrible at that, too.\n\nNow she and her two friends must study to become better at magic so they can become good witches. That is, if they can focus on their magic studies!\n\nThe three apprentices will need all the luck they can get if they want to pass the witch exams and become full-fledged witches. Only then will Doremi's debt to the witch Majorika be repaid. Until then, Doremi will remain a useless little witch girl!","background":null,"season":"winter","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"08:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 08:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1415,"type":"anime","name":"Asahi Broadcasting","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1415/Asahi_Broadcasting"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":252,"type":"anime","name":"4Kids Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/252/4Kids_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":4175,"type":"manga","name":"Ojamajo Doremi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/4175/Ojamajo_Doremi"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":351,"type":"anime","name":"Ojamajo Doremi Sharp","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/351/Ojamajo_Doremi_Sharp"}]},{"relation":"Spin-off","entry":[{"mal_id":39585,"type":"anime","name":"Majo Minarai wo Sagashite","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39585/Majo_Minarai_wo_Sagashite"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":39588,"type":"anime","name":"Ojamajo Doremi: Owarai Gekijou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39588/Ojamajo_Doremi__Owarai_Gekijou"},{"mal_id":50848,"type":"anime","name":"Ojamajo Doremi: Honobono Gekijou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50848/Ojamajo_Doremi__Honobono_Gekijou"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Ojamajo Carnival!!
