Whether it's hanging out with friends or cramming for tests, everyone has something they will remember from that time in their lives. At a certain high school, one class is faced with an event that can cause people to look back on their high school days in sadness: the death of a student.\n\nThe deceased is not just any student—she's Tomie Kawakami, a popular girl with an almost otherworldly beauty. Her death was particularly gruesome: her body was dismembered and the pieces scattered. As the class tries to make sense of the situation, they are shocked when a familiar voice calls out to them from the doorway, apologizing for being late.\n\nWith raven hair and a beauty mark under her left eye, this girl is the spitting image of their murdered classmate. But she can't actually be Tomie, right?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Included with the second and third volumes of the Ito Junji: Collection Bluray/DVD releases.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":43,"type":"anime","name":"Josei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":912,"type":"manga","name":"Tomie","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/912/Tomie"}]},{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":36124,"type":"anime","name":"Itou Junji: Collection","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36124/Itou_Junji__Collection"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
