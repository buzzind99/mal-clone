As he is giving him a tour of the city, Falco suggests they visit the slave market: a place where captured women are sold at exorbitant prices to wealthy bureaucrats. Casius is initially hesitant to take part in the debauchery, but eventually has a change of heart and buys the girls in order to protect them. Unbeknownst to him, the girls he purchased will soon send him headfirst into a series of tumultuous events.\n\nDorei Ichiba follows Casius as he spends his days in the foreign city with his three slaves—Bianca, a childish woman who calls him 'big brother'; Cecilia, a peasant who ran away from her abusive, blue-blooded fiance; and Myia, a mute girl with dark secrets. As he uncovers their tragic stories while making love to them, he finds himself slowly succumbing to a carnal desire that threatens to change him for good.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Based on the game developed by rúf in 2000.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":294,"type":"anime","name":"Discovery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/294/Discovery"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":284,"type":"anime","name":"Central Park Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"},{"mal_id":296,"type":"anime","name":"Critical Mass Video","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/296/Critical_Mass_Video"}],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":78939,"type":"manga","name":"Dorei Ichiba","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/78939/Dorei_Ichiba"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"To lose in amber\" by Shimamiya Eiko"],"endings":["1: \"To lose in amber\" by Shimamiya Eiko","2: \"Inori no Toki\" by MELL"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
