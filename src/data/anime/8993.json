Naruto appears to be an overbearing sis-con. In fact, he's madly in love with Anzu, because they're not blood-related. He confines her to the family mansion for \"security,\" depriving her of companionship and a real life. At age 16, she starts to rebel. She smuggles in a kitten as a pet (Naruto hates cats) and then escapes in a delivery truck. Naruto catches up to her and realizes that she can't be confined like a bird in a cage. He agrees to let have a normal life, but just then, tragedy strikes \n\n(Source: Collectr)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1065,"type":"anime","name":"Public & Basic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1065/Public___Basic"},{"mal_id":1187,"type":"anime","name":"Ripple Film","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1187/Ripple_Film"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":20910,"type":"manga","name":"Juliet","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/20910/Juliet"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
