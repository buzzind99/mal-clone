Chairman Gapporin hires Okkanabichi the supreme racer, while Chairman Misaki hires Riki Kazama, a relatively untried driver for the flying car known as Machine Hiryu. Mixing elements of Speed Racer with Time Bokan, this Tatsunoko production ticks the same boxes, with Riki's cute girlfriend Nana, mini-mechanic Chuta, the cute ape and pooch, and the comic and glamorous villains lurking in the background. Early work from many big names, including Yoshitaka Amano and Kunio Okawara, is strictly in the studio mould. Manga versions of the story ran in several magazines, such as Terebi Magazine and Terebi Land. Racing fever seemed to have struck the Japanese animation business at this time: compare to the same year's Arrow Emblem.\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1977,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"19:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 19:30 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"},{"mal_id":103,"type":"anime","name":"Tatsunoko Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"},{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Racing","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":["\"Tobidase!
