These fairies are the extremely peppy Kururu, the reserved and feminine Chiriri, the samurai-loving tomboy Sarara, and the quiet yet quirky Hororo.\n\nFascinated by the human world, these fairies arrived from the fairy world in hopes of participating in the annual traditions and overall way of human life. However, they have a very limited understanding of the human world. Luckily, they are befriended and guided by two humans—\"Sensei-san,\" a university student who they live with, and a first-grade girl they call \"Tama-chan,\" who is sometimes as naive as the fairies themselves.\n\nThough these bottle fairies have strange ideas and sometimes have difficulty understanding this new world, they try to make the most of the human experience in their own cute little ways.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2003,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Saturdays at Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":34,"type":"anime","name":"Hal Film Maker","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/34/Hal_Film_Maker"},{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"},{"mal_id":92,"type":"anime","name":"Starchild Records","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/92/Starchild_Records"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Xebec","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":["\"Oshiete Sensei-san (教えてせんせいさん )\" by Bottle Fairy"],"endings":["1: \"Haru-uta ~Kururu~\" by Kururu/Nana Mizuki (eps 01-03)","2: \"Natsu uta ~Chiriri~\" by Nazuka Kaori/Chiriri (eps 04-06)","3: \"Aki Uta ~Sarara~\" by Sarara/Yui Horie (eps 07-09)","4: \"Fuyu Uta ~Hororo~\" by Hororo/Ai Nonaka (eps 10-12)","5: \"Shiki Uta ~Binzume Yousei~\" by Bottle Fairy (eps 13)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
