Imagine your classic D&amp;D party—Fighter, Thief, Bard, Mage, Healer ...and Porter? Okay, don't know where the Porter comes from, but Pastel and her group of adventurers are broke and need a job. They can't afford to buy any of the adventure modules from the module seller, so they have to take part-time jobs to pay off their debts. And an innocent job to fetch holy water leads to world-threatening danger ...and a white dragon.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo.com)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":42353,"type":"manga","name":"Fortune Quest","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/42353/Fortune_Quest"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":3185,"type":"anime","name":"Fortune Quest L","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3185/Fortune_Quest_L"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["1: \"Fortune Quest: Itsuka Kanau Yume (フォーチュン・クエスト~いつか叶う夢)\" by Rumi Kasahara","2: \"Mayoi no Mori (迷いの森)\" by Miwako Saitou"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
