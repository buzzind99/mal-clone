The high-scorers in the student council, in particular the student council president, have a lot of authority. Yuria Aikawa comes to this school, and though she seems like an ordinary girl who loves fun things and her boyfriend Shuri, she's actually a super-genius who gets the top score on every test. She becomes student council president and tries to make school life more fun in various ways.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":90980,"type":"manga","name":"Elite Jack!!","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/90980/Elite_Jack"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
