Unbeknownst to Raidou, Reina shares the same sentiment, but she has a problem. Awkward and timid, Reina is incapable of determining how chummy she has to be when approaching a person.\n\nDue to Reina's complete inability to gauge personal space, the two struggle to spark their unlikely friendship, as even the simplest tasks like talking seem impossible for them. But despite the countless yet pointless challenges that hinder the pair, the overly imaginative Raidou will do whatever it takes to befriend the indecipherable Reina.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"02:25","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 02:25 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1414,"type":"anime","name":"bilibili","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1414/bilibili"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1440,"type":"anime","name":"Felix Film","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1440/Felix_Film"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":103939,"type":"manga","name":"Aharen-san wa Hakarenai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/103939/Aharen-san_wa_Hakarenai"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":51243,"type":"anime","name":"Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Mini","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/51243/Aharen-san_wa_Hakarenai_Mini"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Hanarenai Kyori (はなれない距離)\" by TrySail"],"endings":["1: \"Kyori-kan (キョリ感)\" by HaKoniwalily (ハコニワリリィ) (eps 1-2)","2: \"AHAREN HEART\" by Reina Aharen (CV: Inori Minase) (eps 3)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-282594"},{"name":"Aniplus TV","url":"http://www.aniplustv.com/"},{"name":"Bilibili Global","url":"https://www.bilibili.tv/en/index"},{"name":"Laftel","url":"https://laftel.net/"}]}}
