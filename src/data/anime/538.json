But not everyone is happy to hear he is moving away, as his female friends sulk and complain at the prospect of him being alone. However, Tenchi is not by himself for very long, as he soon meets a kind and compassionate girl named Sakuya Kumashiro who helps him get used to life in Tokyo.\n\nThe two become close friends, but Sakuya wants more than just that, so she proclaims her love for Tenchi. This confession comes as a shock not only to Tenchi, but also the girls back home. In response, the girls decide to step up their game, and they immediately flock to Tokyo to take Tenchi for themselves. \n\nWith the girls competing for his love, Tenchi must decide once and for all who the most important woman in his life is. However, he is going to have a hard time deciding, as strange events start happening that drive Tenchi further apart from his friends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1997,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":204,"type":"anime","name":"Pioneer LDC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/204/Pioneer_LDC"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":539,"type":"anime","name":"Tenchi Muyou!
