Brought together by arcade games, what began as a healthy rivalry and friendship has turned into something more. As they endeavour towards understanding their unfamiliar feelings, they work with allies, navigate high school, and find that, although life has its many challenges, there's always a game or two they can rely on.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2019,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:05","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:05 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":306,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Capsule","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/306/Magic_Capsule"},{"mal_id":415,"type":"anime","name":"Warner Bros.
