Lawrence and his sharp-witted partner continue to make some small profits along the way, while slowly uncovering more information about Holo's hometown. However, the road to Yoitsu is a bumpy one filled with many troubles—Lawrence runs into a charming young fellow merchant who has his eyes set on the female wolf companion, and he begins to doubt if Holo will remain by his side; he and the goddess will also have to consider precarious and risky business deals as Lawrence strives to achieve his dream of becoming a shopowner. All the while, with his determination tested at every turn during his journey, Lawrence must question his relationship with Holo, take on business ventures, and ask himself whether it is time for him and Holo to go their separate ways.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2009,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":75,"type":"anime","name":"Imagin","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/75/Imagin"},{"mal_id":464,"type":"anime","name":"flying DOG","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/112/Brains_Base"},{"mal_id":553,"type":"anime","name":"Marvy Jack","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/553/Marvy_Jack"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":9115,"type":"manga","name":"Ookami to Koushinryou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/9115/Ookami_to_Koushinryou"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":6007,"type":"anime","name":"Ookami to Koushinryou II: Ookami to Kohakuiro no Yuuutsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6007/Ookami_to_Koushinryou_II__Ookami_to_Kohakuiro_no_Yuuutsu"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":6884,"type":"anime","name":"Ookami to Koushinryou II: Holo no Short Anime","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6884/Ookami_to_Koushinryou_II__Holo_no_Short_Anime"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Mitsu no Yoake (蜜の夜明け - Honey Dawn)\" by Akino Arai"],"endings":["\"Perfect World\" by ROCKY CHACK"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-275311"}]}}
