At least, that's what he thought...\n\nLittle did he know that his student was Ichirou Matsushita, a young boy with the mind of a genius and a terrifying hidden agenda. It doesn't take long for Satou to realize that he is the second home tutor in as many weeks that has been sent to teach the little boy. What's even more unnerving is that the previous Tutor's whereabouts appear to be a mystery...\n\nThe little boy's true identity is revealed when he puts Satou under a curse, turning him into a lizard man and making him one of servants. Little Ichirou Matsushita is none other than \"Akuma-kun\" boy genius and master of black magic. His goal? To open the portal between hell and earth, summon forth hell's most powerful demons, and enlist their help in taking over the world!","background":"In commemoration of Shigeru Mizuki's 100th birthday.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":354,"type":"anime","name":"Encourage Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/354/Encourage_Films"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":23187,"type":"manga","name":"Akuma-kun","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/23187/Akuma-kun"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":8194,"type":"anime","name":"Akuma-kun","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/8194/Akuma-kun"},{"mal_id":8226,"type":"anime","name":"Akuma-kun (Movie)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/8226/Akuma-kun_Movie"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
