However, unease looms as Saki begins to question the fate of those unable to awaken to their powers, and the children begin to get involved with secretive matters such as the rumored Tainted Cats said to abduct children.\n\nShinsekai yori tells the unique coming-of-age story of Saki and her friends as they journey to grow into their roles in the supposed utopia. Accepting these roles, however, might not come easy when faced with the dark and shocking truths of society, and the impending havoc born from the new world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"TV Asahi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":56,"type":"anime","name":"A-1 Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":116479,"type":"manga","name":"Shinsekai yori","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/116479/Shinsekai_yori"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Yuki ni Saku Hana (雪に咲く花)\" by Maria Akizuki (Kana Hanazawa) (eps 16)"],"endings":["1: \"Wareta Ringo (割れたリンゴ)\" by Saki Watanabe (Risa Taneda) (eps 1-16)","2: \"Yuki ni Saku Hana (雪に咲く花)\" by Maria Akizuki (Kana Hanazawa) (eps 17-24)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-249152"},{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https://www.hidive.com/tv/from-the-new-world"},{"name":"Shahid","url":"https://shahid.mbc.net/en/series/From-The-New-World/series-910726"}]}}
