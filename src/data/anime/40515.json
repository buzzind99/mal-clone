Their daughter Ayumu has just finished her track practice while their son Gou is playing video games at home. However, life as they know it is flipped upside down when a calamitous earthquake strikes the entire Japanese archipelago—obliterating the face of the country in an instant.\n\nWith society crumbling around them and their nation gradually sinking into the ocean, the Mutou family must band together to survive the catastrophe. Treading the near-apocalyptic setting, they struggle not only to stay alive, but also to learn the difficulty of coping with loss.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Nihon Chinbotsu 2020 is an original net animation and one of many works based on Sakyo Komatsu's award-winning 1973 disaster novel of the same name.
