But Michael's own daily life is rich in all kinds of little incidents and upheavals-avoiding local bad cat Nyazilla, a monster against whom Michael knows he'll always come out worse, scrounging food from local stores, meeting up with his animal friends, and keeping the humans amused as best he can. And Michael also has a fantasy life even his fellow feline Garfield would envy, with cat corporations, cat nightclubs, and his own imitation of a dancing American megastar also called Michael.\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1988,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":829,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Jack","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/829/Studio_Jack"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Daume","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/39/Daume"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":71,"type":"anime","name":"Pets","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/71/Pets"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":3160,"type":"manga","name":"What's Michael?","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/3160/Whats_Michael"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":12005,"type":"anime","name":"What's Michael?","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12005/Whats_Michael"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
