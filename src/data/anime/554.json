While the Imperial Army wanted to use the Steel Angel as a new means of modern warfare, Ayanokoji wanted his creation to be a new step in the future of mankind. Thus, he defied orders from the Army and secretly made the Steel Angel codenamed \"Kurumi\". Then one day, a young boy named Nakahito Kagura snuck into Ayanokoji's house as a dare by his friends and stumbled upon Kurumi's lifeless body. A sudden attack by the Imperial Army shook the house, causing Kurumi to fall on Nakahito. At that moment, their lips met, and Kurumi woke up from \"the kiss that started a miracle\". \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":3414,"type":"manga","name":"Koutetsu Tenshi Kurumi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/3414/Koutetsu_Tenshi_Kurumi"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":555,"type":"anime","name":"Koutetsu Tenshi Kurumi 2","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/555/Koutetsu_Tenshi_Kurumi_2"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":557,"type":"anime","name":"Koutetsu Tenshi Kurumi Encore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/557/Koutetsu_Tenshi_Kurumi_Encore"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Kiss Kara Hajimaru Miracle\" by Steel Angels (eps (eps.1-23))"],"endings":["1: \"Eien no Kotetsu Tenshi\" by Steel Angels (eps (eps.1-23))","2: \"Kiss Kara Hajimaru Miracle\" by Steel Angels (eps (ep.24))"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
