Each nations solution: to gain possession of Decimators, the same ancient robots of war that nearly ended all life on the planet 200 years before. As the war ensues and the leaders of both nations become reluctant to surrender, only the desperate plan of Lean, a young cadet, and Nataruma, a psychically gifted young woman, to alter the timeline of events 200 years before stands the chance between humanity's survival or absolute destruction. \n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":947,"type":"anime","name":"Manga Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/947/Manga_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":2089,"type":"anime","name":"Choujikuu Seiki Orguss","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2089/Choujikuu_Seiki_Orguss"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Fushigi wo Mitsumete (不思議を見つめて)\" by Hikashu (eps 1-4)","2: \"Uchū de Mita Yume (宇宙で見た夢; The Dream I Had in the Cosmos)\" by Hiroe Ueda (eps 5-6)"],"endings":["1: \"Black Box (ブラックボックス)\" by Hikashu (eps 1-4)","2: \"旅人-Tabibito\" by Hiroe Ueda (eps 5-6)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
