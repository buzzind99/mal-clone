While considering the offer, he recalls his last months of service.\n\nHis last mission, Operation Foot Stamp, had been a highly classified military strike against the Southeast Asian Union. The operation quickly went south for the ground forces, and Sugou's First Guardian drone was ordered in as air support to drop emergency supplies for the ground units and then return to base. Following orders against his own judgement, Sugou abandoned his comrades on the field.\n\nMany lives were lost during the operation, including Itsuki Ootomo, Sugou's commanding officer. However, three months later, following a massacre at the Ministry of Defence, Otomo was spotted at the scene on camera. Now a suspect in an act of terrorism, Sugou cooperates with Enforcer Tomomi Masaoka and Criminal Investigation Department's Division 01 as they hunt his former mentor down.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":459,"type":"anime","name":"Nitroplus","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/459/Nitroplus"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"},{"mal_id":1996,"type":"anime","name":"MAGNET","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1996/MAGNET"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":135242,"type":"manga","name":"Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System Case.2 - First Guardian","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/135242/Psycho-Pass__Sinners_of_the_System_Case2_-_First_Guardian"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":37440,"type":"anime","name":"Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System Case.1 - Tsumi to Batsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37440/Psycho-Pass__Sinners_of_the_System_Case1_-_Tsumi_to_Batsu"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":37442,"type":"anime","name":"Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System Case.3 - Onshuu no Kanata ni＿＿","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37442/Psycho-Pass__Sinners_of_the_System_Case3_-_Onshuu_no_Kanata_ni＿＿"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"abnormalize (remix)\" by Ling Tosite Sigure"],"endings":["\"All Alone With You\" by EGOIST"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
