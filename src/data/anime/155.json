Kamui Shirou's destiny has been decided as he returns to Tokyo to face his ultimate challenge. The Dragon of Heaven, defenders of the Earth, stand ready to protect the world from the Dragon of Earth, the seven angels of legend, who embrace the devastation of the planet to bring about its purification. Now Kamui must decide which side to fight for although he finds the idea utterly unappealing. It isn't until realizing that his two childhood friends, Fuma and Kotori Monou, are in grievous peril that Kamui decides to step into his fated position in the climactic struggle of the Year of Destiny: 1999. \n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":123,"type":"anime","name":"Victor Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/123/Victor_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":165,"type":"anime","name":"Marubeni","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/165/Marubeni"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":167,"type":"anime","name":"Sega","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/167/Sega"},{"mal_id":168,"type":"anime","name":"Shelty","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/168/Shelty"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":947,"type":"anime","name":"Manga Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/947/Manga_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"manga","name":"X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/27/X"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":156,"type":"anime","name":"X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/156/X"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":2729,"type":"anime","name":"X²: Double X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2729/X²__Double_X"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Forever Love\" by X Japan"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
