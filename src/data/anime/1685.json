Through a card game, duelists can bring these worlds into existence, making what was previously abstract into reality. These skilled duelists are known as Kaijudo masters.\n\nShobu Kirifuda is the best player at his local playground, and seeks to become a world-class master like his father. His first step on the road to conquest begins with winning a local tournament. Rather, it should have, except he is destroyed by the best Kaijudo master in the world, Knight. Shobu loses, but upon remembering the words of wisdom his father instilled into him, decides to continue on the road of becoming a duelist who can enjoy the game for what it is. And so begins his journey to victory－and as we all know, the journey is the most important part!","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2002,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":829,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Jack","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/829/Studio_Jack"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":465,"type":"anime","name":"Hasbro","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/465/Hasbro"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":101,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Hibari","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/101/Studio_Hibari"},{"mal_id":179,"type":"anime","name":"A.C.G.T.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/179/ACGT"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Strategy Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":18269,"type":"manga","name":"Duel Masters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/18269/Duel_Masters"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":3669,"type":"anime","name":"Duel Masters Movie 1: Yami no Shiro no Maryuuou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3669/Duel_Masters_Movie_1__Yami_no_Shiro_no_Maryuuou"},{"mal_id":6062,"type":"anime","name":"Duel Masters Movie 2: Lunatic God Saga","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6062/Duel_Masters_Movie_2__Lunatic_God_Saga"},{"mal_id":9282,"type":"anime","name":"Duel Masters Movie 3: Honoo no Kizuna XX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9282/Duel_Masters_Movie_3__Honoo_no_Kizuna_XX"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":4443,"type":"anime","name":"Duel Masters Charge","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4443/Duel_Masters_Charge"}]},{"relation":"Spin-off","entry":[{"mal_id":10525,"type":"anime","name":"Shinseiki Duel Masters Flash","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10525/Shinseiki_Duel_Masters_Flash"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Yume ga Kanau Toki (夢が叶うとき)\" by Nao"],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
