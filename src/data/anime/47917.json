On a fateful day, Bocchi meets the outgoing drummer Nijika Ijichi, who invites her to join Kessoku Band when their guitarist, Ikuyo Kita, flees before their first show. Soon after, Bocchi meets her final bandmate—the cool bassist Ryou Yamada. \n\nAlthough their first performance together is subpar, the girls feel empowered by their shared love for music, and they are soon rejoined by Kita. Finding happiness in performing, Bocchi and her bandmates put their hearts into improving as musicians while making the most of their fleeting high school days.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":797,"type":"anime","name":"Houbunsha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/797/Houbunsha"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1835,"type":"anime","name":"CloverWorks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1835/CloverWorks"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":118568,"type":"manga","name":"Bocchi the Rock!","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/118568/Bocchi_the_Rock"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Seishun Complex (青春コンプレックス)\" by Kessoku Band (結束バンド)"],"endings":["1: \"Distortion!!\" by Kessoku Band (結束バンド) (eps 1-3)","2: \"Karakara (カラカラ)\" by Kessoku Band (結束バンド) (eps 4-7)","3: \"Nani ga Warui (なにが悪い)\" by Kessoku Band (結束バンド) (eps 8-11)","4: \"Korogaru Iwa, Kimi ni Asa ga Furu (転がる岩、君に朝が降る)\" by Kessoku Band (結束バンド) (eps 12)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-283152"},{"name":"Aniplus Asia","url":"https://www.aniplus-asia.com/"},{"name":"Bahamut Anime Crazy","url":"https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"},{"name":"Bilibili Global","url":"https://www.bilibili.tv/en/index"}]}}
