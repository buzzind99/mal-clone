Chasing it into the forest, she finds \"Totoro\"—a giant, mystical forest spirit whom she soon befriends. Before long, Satsuki too meets Totoro, and the two girls suddenly find their lives filled with magical adventures in nature and fantastical creatures of the woods.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"In 1988, Tonari no Totoro won the Best Film and Ofuji Noburo awards in the Mainichi Film Awards, the Special Award in the 31st Blue Ribbon Awards, the Grand Prix in the Animage Anime Awards, and the Best Film and Reader's Choice Award: Best Japanese Film awards in the Kinema Junpo Awards.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Fantasia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/24/Studio_Fantasia"},{"mal_id":2518,"type":"anime","name":"Streamline Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2518/Streamline_Pictures"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":417,"type":"anime","name":"Disney Platform Distribution","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/417/Disney_Platform_Distribution"},{"mal_id":783,"type":"anime","name":"GKIDS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/783/GKIDS"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Ghibli","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/21/Studio_Ghibli"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Spin-off","entry":[{"mal_id":2488,"type":"anime","name":"Mei to Koneko Bus","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2488/Mei_to_Koneko_Bus"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Sanpo (さんぽ; Stroll)\" by Azumi Inoue"],"endings":["\"Tonari no Totoro (となりのトトロ; My Neighbor Totoro)\" by Azumi Inoue"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Netflix","url":"https://www.netflix.com/"}]}}
