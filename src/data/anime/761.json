The miraculous plant is seemingly Konohamaru's only hope to prevent the departure of his sweetheart Kaede Yoshino, who must leave Konohagakure on account of her father's job. Despite the unique clover being located in a forbidden area, there is nothing stopping the two from bravely embarking on a perilous adventure to achieve their goal.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Naruto: Akaki Yotsuba no Clover wo Sagase is the original series' first OVA that, along with Naruto: Takigakure no Shitou - Ore ga Eiyuu Dattebayo!, was shown exclusively at the annual Shonen Jump Festival in Japan. The OVA falls within the same timeline of the series between the \"Prologue—Land Of Waves\" and \"Chunin Exams\" arcs, or from episodes 19 to 20 respectively. Madman Entertainment included the special in the Naruto Jump Festa Collection released in 2008. Unlike the second OVA which also received a dubbed version, Naruto: Akaki Yotsuba no Clover wo Sagase has only been subtitled.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Naruto","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/20/Naruto"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Naruto Main Theme\" by Toshiro Masuda"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
