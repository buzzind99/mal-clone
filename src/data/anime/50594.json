As if drawn by something, Suzume reaches for the door...\n\nBefore long, doors begin to open one after another in various parts of Japan. As disasters come from the far side of the doors, the open doors must be closed.\n\nThe stars, the setting sun, and the morning sky—in that place she wandered into, there was a sky that seemingly blended all of time together. Guided by the mysterious doors, Suzume's \"door-locking journey\" begins.\n\n(Source: MAL News)","background":"Film had its first preview screening in IMAX on November 7th, 2022.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1956,"type":"anime","name":"STORY","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1956/STORY"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":291,"type":"anime","name":"CoMix Wave Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/291/CoMix_Wave_Films"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":152974,"type":"manga","name":"Suzume no Tojimari","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/152974/Suzume_no_Tojimari"},{"mal_id":153041,"type":"manga","name":"Shousetsu Suzume no Tojimari","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/153041/Shousetsu_Suzume_no_Tojimari"}]},{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":53731,"type":"anime","name":"Big Mac to, Susume","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/53731/Big_Mac_to_Susume"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
