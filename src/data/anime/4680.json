He must contend with students who spy on him and pull nasty stunts and with a landlord who constantly tries to sell him worthless antiques. While on a fishing trip to boost his spirits, Bocchan suspects Hotta, his one friend in the village, as the cause of all of his misery. But this is just beginning of his problems…During a meeting to discuss the students' disrespectful behavior towards Bocchan, the proposed punishment is surprisingly mild despite the severity of the acts. Yet, Bocchan's suspected adversary defends him! Were the other faculty members lying about Hotta? Bocchan may soon discover the truth, for when evidence of the dean’s activities surface, Bocchan and Hotta must team up to corner the dean in his own scandalous game! \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":73,"type":"anime","name":"TMS Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/73/TMS_Entertainment"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":4723,"type":"anime","name":"Seishun Anime Zenshuu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4723/Seishun_Anime_Zenshuu"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Yoi Uta\" (酔歌) by Duke Aces"],"endings":["\"Touzainanboku (東西南北)\" by Duke Aces"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
