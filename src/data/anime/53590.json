Together, the unlikely pair set off on a journey, salvaging rubbish to survive. Along the way they'll win hearts, evade danger, and discover there's more to starless Ivy than meets the eye! \n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"},{"mal_id":72,"type":"anime","name":"Reincarnation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/72/Reincarnation"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":152709,"type":"manga","name":"Saijaku Tamer wa Gomi Hiroi no Tabi wo Hajimemashita.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/152709/Saijaku_Tamer_wa_Gomi_Hiroi_no_Tabi_wo_Hajimemashita"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
