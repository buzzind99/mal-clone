It was said that they lived in rivers and lakes. In fact, there were people who saw them. You can find Kappa as a subject in paintings, sculptures and stories. In the 20th century, Japan has become a highly industrialized country. Reclaimed lakes, rivers with concreted banks, large quantities of chemicals for the fields. Fish, insects, birds and animals lost their home. So did Kappa. This film depicts the waterside scene in Japan when Kappa lived vividly. We might have a chance to see them if we could prevent the further environmental pollution and make it easier for the other creatures to live.\n\n(Source: ASIFA-Japan)","background":"Winner of the 1998 Noburou Oofuji Award.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
