A whale appears from a glassy ocean and spends half a day soaring gracefully across the skies. What makes this works extraordinary is the artist's decision to use the transparency and visual bulk of 3D computer graphics only for the un-moving ocean and glaciers. The people, whale, and ships are all hand-drawn, and with this contrast, he invites the viewer into a different world. This is a poem written in animation, the creation of a true fantasy. This project was a considerable under taking, and the results are marvelous.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":"Winner of the Grand Prize at the 2nd Japan Media Arts Festival.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":184,"type":"anime","name":"Ai ga areba Daijobu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/184/Ai_ga_areba_Daijobu"},{"mal_id":2276,"type":"anime","name":"Project Team Sarah","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2276/Project_Team_Sarah"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":388,"type":"anime","name":"Tamura Shigeru Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/388/Tamura_Shigeru_Studio"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":6094,"type":"anime","name":"A Piece of Phantasmagoria","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6094/A_Piece_of_Phantasmagoria"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
