Its inhabitants partake the journey to migrate back to Earth.\n\nAttempting to regenerate the Earth to make it hospitable, the migrants come up with a \"Zi-Forming\" scheme.\n\nHowever, the plan fails and Earth is left in its state of turmoil. Overrun by Zoids and blanked by unstable weather phenomena, the migrants are faced with a difficult life. The Empire and Republic settlements attempt to uncover Zoids buried within the Earth to bolster their respective armies.\n\nThe story picks up following second-generation Earth citizens: Leo Conrad and Buzz Cunningham, who have a chance encounter with a girl Sally Land as she flees the clutches of the Empire.\n\n(Source: Zoids Wiki)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2019,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"17:55","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 17:55 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":37395,"type":"anime","name":"Zoids Wild","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37395/Zoids_Wild"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":42885,"type":"anime","name":"Zoids Wild Senki","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/42885/Zoids_Wild_Senki"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"blue blue blue\" by Ivy to Fraudulent Game (eps 1-24)","2: \"Player\" by MAGIC OF LiFE (eps 25-50)"],"endings":["1: \"Hikari (ヒカリ)\" by Hazuki Senda (千田葉月)","2: \"DOOR\" by Maju Arai (荒井麻珠)","3: \"Yume no Wadachi (夢の轍)\" by H△G","4: \"Na mo Naki Tabi (名もなき旅)\" by Hazuki Senda"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
