These encounters allow Natsume to better understand the youkai, Reiko, and himself. \n\nThe Book of Friends is a powerful tool that can be used to control youkai; it is sought after by both youkai and exorcists alike. Natsume just wants to live out his daily life in peace but is constantly disrupted by these experiences. If he is to end this torment, Natsume must explore more about the book and the world of exorcism, as well as begin to open his heart to those who can help him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"01:35","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 01:35 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":148,"type":"anime","name":"Hakusensha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/148/Hakusensha"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1119,"type":"anime","name":"Shuka","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1119/Shuka"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1859,"type":"manga","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/1859/Natsume_Yuujinchou"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":32983,"type":"anime","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou Go","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/32983/Natsume_Yuujinchou_Go"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":36275,"type":"anime","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou Roku Specials","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36275/Natsume_Yuujinchou_Roku_Specials"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":36538,"type":"anime","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou Movie: Utsusemi ni Musubu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36538/Natsume_Yuujinchou_Movie__Utsusemi_ni_Musubu"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Floria (フローリア)\" by Tomohisa Sako"],"endings":["\"Kimi no Uta (きみのうた)\" by Rei Yasuda"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-272983"}]}}
