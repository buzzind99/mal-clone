Because of steam, the city is sometimes covered in a mist. Villains take advantage of the steamy mist to hide and execute their evil plans. Only a few dare venture into what's beyond the steamy mist. They are known as the Steam Detectives: Narutaki (and his convertible all-purpose pistol), his nurse-assistant Lingling, and his Megamaton robot Gohliki.\n \n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1998,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":216,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Tron","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/216/Studio_Tron"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Xebec","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":243,"type":"manga","name":"Kaiketsu Jouki Tanteidan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/243/Kaiketsu_Jouki_Tanteidan"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Kimi, Hohoenda Yoru (君, 微笑んだ夜)\" by Elika"],"endings":["1: \"Okubyou Emotion\" by Elika","2: \"Oasis\" by Elika"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
