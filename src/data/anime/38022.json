Lucifer—a leader of the Angelic Guard with a rebellious streak, said to wield power rivaling the Almighty—carries out her duty along with Uriel, also a leader of the guard. Together, they go about executing their mission, until Holy Magistrate Keter—the one who leads the heavens under the Almighty's will—tells Uriel of Lucifer's planned rebellion. Initially in disbelief, Uriel then learns that the accusations against Lucifer may be connected to an event that once threatened to shatter the heavens.\n\n(Source: Official YouTube Channel)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1572,"type":"anime","name":"XFLAG","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1572/XFLAG"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":298,"type":"anime","name":"Anima","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/298/Anima"},{"mal_id":1169,"type":"anime","name":"ILCA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1169/ILCA"},{"mal_id":1253,"type":"anime","name":"Studio GOONEYS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1253/Studio_GOONEYS"},{"mal_id":1263,"type":"anime","name":"Dynamo Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1263/Dynamo_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1976,"type":"anime","name":"CGCG Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1976/CGCG_Studio"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Video Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/79/Video_Game"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":38021,"type":"anime","name":"Monster Strike the Movie: Sora no Kanata","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38021/Monster_Strike_the_Movie__Sora_no_Kanata"},{"mal_id":41519,"type":"anime","name":"Monster Strike the Movie: Lucifer - Zetsubou no Yoake","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/41519/Monster_Strike_the_Movie__Lucifer_-_Zetsubou_no_Yoake"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":38024,"type":"anime","name":"Monster Strike The Animation Episode 0","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38024/Monster_Strike_The_Animation_Episode_0"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["1: \"Monster Strike Main Theme Animation Ver\" by Riichiro Kuwabara (eps 1-7, 10-11, 18, 20-24, 57)","2: \"Lucifer - Fallen Angel of Rebellion\" by Masaru Yokoyama (eps 8,51)","3: \"Let's Dance!!\" by Tomotaka Oosumi (eps 9)","4: \"Prelude to Darkness\" by Masaru Yokoyama (eps 2)","5: \"WHAT YOU WANT\" by Nana Mizuki (eps 13-17)","6: \"Solomon Main Theme\" by Moe Hyuuga (eps 25-37)","7: \"Born Free\" by Nana Mizuki (eps 38-44)","8: \"Hero\" by Masayoshi Ooishi (eps 45, 47-48)","9: \"Departure\" by Masayoshi Ooishi (eps 50)","10: \"BRAVE OUT\" by KNOCK OUT MONKEY (eps 52-56)","11: \"Kimi Sora\" by LELLE (レルエ) (eps 58-62)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-271995"}]}}
