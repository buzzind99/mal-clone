Although it seems that he may not be destined for great things in life as his mother wishes, McDull never gives up.\n\nThe story focuses on several tales about McDull and his childhood. This is told as a narrative reflection of a now adult McDull. These tales muddle up in imaginative uses of Cantonese and heaps of local Hong Kong culture. From tales about a turkey dinner to dreams of following in Lee Lai-shan's footsteps, McDull faces ebbs and flows with his demanding but devoted mother.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":"The film won Best Animation Feature at the 39th Golden Horse Awards.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":445,"type":"anime","name":"Bliss Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/445/Bliss_Pictures"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Anthropomorphic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":9818,"type":"anime","name":"McDull: Boluo You Wang Zi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9818/McDull__Boluo_You_Wang_Zi"}]},{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":43313,"type":"anime","name":"McDull: Niu Hua Chen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/43313/McDull__Niu_Hua_Chen"},{"mal_id":43316,"type":"anime","name":"McDull: Kuaile Di Tan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/43316/McDull__Kuaile_Di_Tan"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
