They soon discover an important clue: Professor Yuko's planner had been marked on the very night she was killed... marked with the names of seven girls. \n\nWith this evidence, the boys begin their investigations... and they'll use any method required in order to find the murderer. Through rape, manipulation and torture, they uncover important details, but piecing the puzzle together won't be easy. And the longer their search draws on, the more they feel themselves being overtaken by their own dark desires...
