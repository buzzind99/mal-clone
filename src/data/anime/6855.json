One day, Wukong accidentally breaks a sword while training with his companions. To find a more suitable weapon for himself, Wukong travels to the Dragon King's palace, where he obtains a powerful staff.\n\nAngered by Wukong's casual theft of his most precious treasure, the Dragon King goes to the Jade Emperor's palace in Heaven to demand retribution. The Jade Emperor hatches a plan to control the devilish monkey—however, Wukong may not be as easy to fool as the monarch thinks.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Da Nao Tiangong is the first feature-length cel-animated film by the Shanghai Animation Film Studio.
