Sometimes, death is worse. There is no salvation, peace, nor god waiting to receive you into their care. But wait, a god? Maybe you are talking about that big black ball stuck in the room with you. Now you are thrown into a game, fighting green aliens and robot monsters for the chance to survive.\n\nWhen Kei Kurono is killed, he thus finds himself caught in such a game—a test of his skills, morals, and will to survive. His life is not his own; his death is spat and trampled upon over and over again. What happens if he does not listen? God knows.\n\nA word of warning: Gantz is not for the faint-hearted, but neither is it as simple as it looks. Gore, rape, and violence is rampant, as are portrayals of greed, violence, and all the ugliness that one sees in society today.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"There is also a live action film adaptation that was released in 2011, and a video game by Konami released on PlayStation 2 in 2005.","season":"spring","year":2004,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Gonzo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3/Gonzo"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"},{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Survival","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/76/Survival"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":564,"type":"manga","name":"Gantz","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/564/Gantz"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":395,"type":"anime","name":"Gantz 2nd Stage","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/395/Gantz_2nd_Stage"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":32071,"type":"anime","name":"Gantz:O","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/32071/Gantz_O"},{"mal_id":40711,"type":"anime","name":"Gantz x Senran Kagura New Link","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/40711/Gantz_x_Senran_Kagura_New_Link"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Super Shooter\" by Rip Slyme"],"endings":["\"Last Kiss\" by Bonnie Pink"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Funimation","url":"https://www.funimation.com/shows/gantz"},{"name":"Netflix","url":"https://www.netflix.com/"}]}}
