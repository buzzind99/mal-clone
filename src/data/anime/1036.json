The cat, Kagetsu, is actually a member of the shape-shifting Kouga tribe and comes to live with Arimasa.\n\nYears later, Arimasa is an uneasy presence in his village. The villagers despise him for being half-fox, but he is also the only one able to protect the village against supernatural invasion. Meanwhile, Kagetsu is going through a difficult period where he must choose which sex he will live the rest of his life as, a process he can only complete through sexual intercourse.\n\nAs pressure from other members of the Kouga clan opposes the wishes in Kagetsu’s heart, Arimasa's village is struck by a large-scale supernatural attack. With his peaceful life threatened, Arimasa will be forced to make undesirable decisions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":149,"type":"anime","name":"SME Visual Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/149/SME_Visual_Works"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":122,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo Kids","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/122/Tokyo_Kids"},{"mal_id":285,"type":"anime","name":"Four Some","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/285/Four_Some"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":10134,"type":"manga","name":"Kasho no Tsuki","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/10134/Kasho_no_Tsuki"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
