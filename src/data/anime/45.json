Feared as a merciless killer, he was unmatched throughout the country, but mysteriously disappeared at the peak of the Japanese Revolution. It has been ten peaceful years since then, but the very mention of Battousai still strikes terror into the hearts of war veterans.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Battousai has abandoned his bloodstained lifestyle in an effort to repent for his sins, now living as Kenshin Himura, a wandering swordsman with a cheerful attitude and a strong will. Vowing never to kill again, Kenshin dedicates himself to protecting the weak. One day, he stumbles across Kaoru Kamiya at her kendo dojo, which is being threatened by an impostor claiming to be Battousai. After receiving help from Kenshin, Kaoru allows him to stay at the dojo, and so the former assassin temporarily ceases his travels.\n\nRurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan tells the story of Kenshin as he strives to save those in need of saving. However, as enemies from both past and present begin to emerge, will the reformed killer be able to uphold his new ideals?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":1996,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"19:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 19:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":149,"type":"anime","name":"SME Visual Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/149/SME_Visual_Works"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"},{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Gallop","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/36/Gallop"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"manga","name":"Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/22/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":44,"type":"anime","name":"Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuioku-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/44/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_-_Tsuioku-hen"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Ishinshishi e no Chinkonka","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/46/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_-_Ishinshishi_e_no_Chinkonka"},{"mal_id":4664,"type":"anime","name":"Rurouni Kenshin: Special Techniques","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4664/Rurouni_Kenshin__Special_Techniques"},{"mal_id":9716,"type":"anime","name":"Rurouni Kenshin: Review Special","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9716/Rurouni_Kenshin__Review_Special"},{"mal_id":12067,"type":"anime","name":"Rurouni Kenshin Special","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12067/Rurouni_Kenshin_Special"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":401,"type":"anime","name":"Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Seisou-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/401/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_-_Seisou-hen"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":6591,"type":"anime","name":"Rurouni Kenshin DVD-BOX Special Ending","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6591/Rurouni_Kenshin_DVD-BOX_Special_Ending"},{"mal_id":11441,"type":"anime","name":"Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Shin Kyoto-hen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/11441/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_-_Shin_Kyoto-hen"},{"mal_id":50613,"type":"anime","name":"Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan (2023)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50613/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_2023"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":10334,"type":"anime","name":"Rurouni Kenshin Recap","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10334/Rurouni_Kenshin_Recap"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":37537,"type":"anime","name":"Sobakasu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37537/Sobakasu"},{"mal_id":50613,"type":"anime","name":"Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan (2023)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50613/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_2023"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Sobakasu (そばかす)\" by JUDY AND MARY (eps 1-38)","2: \"½\" by Makoto Kawamoto (eps 39-82)","3: \"Kimi ni Fureru Dake de (君に触れるだけで)\" by CURIO (eps 83-94)"],"endings":["1: \"Tactics\" by THE YELLOW MONKEY (eps 1-12)","2: \"Namida wa Shitteiru\" by Mayo Suzukaze (eps 13-27)","3: \"HEART OF SWORD ~Yoake Mae~ (HEART OF SWORD 〜夜明け前〜)\" by T.M.Revolution (eps 28-38,43-49)","4: \"the Fourth Avenue Café\" by L'Arc~en~Ciel (eps 39-42)","5: \"It's gonna rain!\" by BONNIE PINK (eps 50-66)","6: \"1/3 no Junjou na Kanjou (1/3の純情な感情)\" by SIAM SHADE (eps 67-82)","7: \"Dame!
