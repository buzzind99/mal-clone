However, instead of attacking Fushi in isolation, Nokkers begin targeting the settlements outside of his reach in hopes of luring him out. Soon, a group known as the Guardians—led by Hisame, the descendant of the deceased warrior Hayase—finds Fushi.\n\nInspired by how Fushi protected Janada Island from the Nokkers years ago, the Guardians have grown a considerable following and are recognized throughout the world. Initially reluctant, Fushi allows the Guardians to accompany him to the site of the Nokkers' recent attack. In their village, Fushi meets a few valuable allies, both new and old. But as the conflict with the Nokkers only leads to more loss, Fushi must find the inner strength to face his inevitable sorrow.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Fumetsu no Anata e 2nd Season was released in two volumes on Blu-ray and DVD from April 26, 2023 to July 26, 2023.","season":"fall","year":2022,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":111,"type":"anime","name":"NHK","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1797,"type":"anime","name":"NHK Enterprises","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1797/NHK_Enterprises"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1967,"type":"anime","name":"Drive","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1967/Drive"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":102343,"type":"manga","name":"Fumetsu no Anata e","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/102343/Fumetsu_no_Anata_e"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":41025,"type":"anime","name":"Fumetsu no Anata e","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/41025/Fumetsu_no_Anata_e"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"PINK BLOOD\" by Hikaru Utada (宇多田ヒカル)"],"endings":["\"ROOTS\" by Masashi Hamauzu (浜渦正志)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-281206"},{"name":"Ani-One Asia","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0wNSTMWIL3qaorLx0jie6A"},{"name":"Aniplus TV","url":"http://www.aniplustv.com/"},{"name":"Bahamut Anime Crazy","url":"https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"},{"name":"Bilibili","url":"https://www.bilibili.com/"},{"name":"Laftel","url":"https://laftel.net/"}]}}
