These meteorites brought a new form of matter known as Möbius Dust to Earth. The dust permeated Earth's atmosphere, leading to a miracle. The day the meteorites fell, nicknamed \"2.29,\" accelerated the economic disparity in Japan.\n\nBefore long, the Bloody War Alliance, discontent with this disparity, began committing acts of terrorism.
