Her knowledge of butterflies, wasps, and more may be the only thing that will help any of her classmates survive to be rescued!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":911,"type":"anime","name":"Passione","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/911/Passione"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Survival","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/76/Survival"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":88675,"type":"manga","name":"Kyochuu Rettou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/88675/Kyochuu_Rettou"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":38915,"type":"anime","name":"Kyochuu Rettou","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38915/Kyochuu_Rettou"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Stellar\" by Haruka Toujou (東城陽奏)"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
