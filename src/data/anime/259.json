Five girls. One roof. It's a recycled idea, but it never gets old. Happy Lesson is a kinetic take on an old genre.\n\nChitose shares his house with five ladies.

Even when things finally calm down at night, all the rooms are taken so Chitose must sleep on the couch.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"KSS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/50/KSS"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":177,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Kyuuma","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/177/Studio_Kyuuma"},{"mal_id":457,"type":"anime","name":"Venet","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/457/Venet"},{"mal_id":462,"type":"anime","name":"Chaos Project","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/462/Chaos_Project"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1785,"type":"manga","name":"Happy★Lesson: Mama Sensei wa Saikou!","url":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/1785/Happy★Lesson__Mama_Sensei_wa_Saikou"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":260,"type":"anime","name":"Happy☆Lesson (TV)","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/260/Happy☆Lesson_TV"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"C°\" by Hikari Okamoto"],"endings":["\"Place\" by Ruri Asano, Akiko Kimura, Kikuko Inoue, Kimiko Furuyama & Kaoru Sasajima"]},"external":[],"streaming":[]}}
